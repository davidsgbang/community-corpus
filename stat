Speaker: annie | Listeners: group
	i'd like to know why i had to find out About this group on accident?
Speaker: abed | Listeners: group
	this is getting way more like breakfast club now.
Speaker: pierce | Listeners: abed
	there's breakfast?
Speaker: britta | Listeners: group
	okay, um, maybe we should get started--
Speaker: jeff | Listeners: group
	you know, i've been a part of a lot of study groups that fell apart because of unresolved tension. Shouldn't we address Annie's concern?  Did we not invite her?
Speaker: shirley | Listeners: jeff
	well, Annie, sweetie, it's not behind your back. We just didn't think about,
Speaker: annie | Listeners: shirley
	can we stop with the "pumpkins" and the "sweeties"? Being younger does not make me inferior. If anything, your age indicates That you've made bad life decisions.
Speaker: jeff | Listeners: shirley
	Shirley has a response to that.
Speaker: shirley | Listeners: jeff
	no, no, no. i don't.
Speaker: troy | Listeners: shirley
	you should. it looks like you do.
Speaker: jeff | Listeners: shirley
	please, Shirley.
Speaker: shirley | Listeners: annie
	okay, okay. I'm sure i've made some bad life decisions And maybe Annie's decisions will be better. But i think she needs to decide Whether she wants to be considered a child Or an adult, because children get pity But not respect. And adults,  they get respect, But they also get the back of they head grabbed  And their face pushed through jukeboxes.
Speaker: britta | Listeners: group
	okay. Why don't we try learning "jukebox" in spanish?
Speaker: shirley | Listeners: pierce
	what are you doing?
Speaker: jeff | Listeners: pierce
	Pierce! Let's discuss this creepiness.
Speaker: pierce | Listeners: jeff
	pardon you?
Speaker: jeff | Listeners: pierce
	Are you unaware that Shirley Finds your advances inappropriate?
Speaker: pierce | Listeners: jeff
	what advances?
Speaker: shirley | Listeners: pierce
	you have been sexually harassing me Since the very first day of class.
Speaker: pierce | Listeners: shirley
	sexually harassing? what? That makes no sense to me. Why would i harass somebody who turns me on?
Speaker: troy | Listeners: pierce
	saying she turns you on is the harassment, dude.
Speaker: pierce | Listeners: troy
	hey.
Speaker: pierce | Listeners: group
	I am a prominent business leader And a highly sought after dinner guest And i will not take courting advice From some teenage boy.
Speaker: troy | Listeners: pierce
	well, this teenage boy  is a quarterback and a prom king.


Speaker: jeff | Listeners: group
	All right, everybody! I want to say something. Everybody, sit down.
Speaker: shirley | Listeners: jeff
	You don't have to yell.
Speaker: jeff | Listeners: group
	You know what makes humans different from other animals?
Speaker: troy | Listeners: jeff
	Feet.
Speaker: pierce | Listeners: troy
	No, no, no, come on. Bears have feet.
Speaker: jeff | Listeners: group
	We're the only species on Earth that observes Shark Week. Sharks don't even observe Shark Week, but we do. For the same reason I can pick up this pencil, tell you it's name is Steve, and go like this. And part of you dies just a little bit on the inside, because people can connect with anything. We can sympathize with a pencil. We can forgive a shark. And we can give Ben Affleck an Academy Award for Screenwriting.
Speaker: pierce | Listeners: group
	Big mistake.
Speaker: troy | Listeners: pierce
	He's got a point.
Speaker: jeff | Listeners: group
	People can find the good in just about anything but themselves. Look at me. It's clear to all of you that I am awesome, but I can never admit that, because that would make me an ass. But what I can do is see what makes Annie awesome. She's driven. We need driven people or the lights go out and the ice cream melts. And Pierce. We need guys like Pierce. This guy has wisdom to offer.
Speaker: pierce | Listeners: group
	The Dalai Lama and I--
Speaker: jeff | Listeners: group
	We should listen to him sometime. We wouldn't regret it. And Shirley. Shirley has earned our respect, Not as a wife, not as a mother, but as a woman. And don't test her on that, because that thing about the jukebox was way too specific to be improvised. And Troy. Who cares if Troy thinks he's all that? Maybe he is. You think astronauts go to the moon because they hate oxygen? No! They're trying to impress their high-school prom king. And Abed. Abed's a shaman. You ask him to pass the salt, he gives you a bowl of soup, because you know what? Soup is better. Abed is better. You are all better than you think you are. You are just designed not to believe it when you hear it from yourself.
Speaker: pierce | Listeners: abed
	Soup?
Speaker: jeff | Listeners: group
	I want you to look to the person to your left. Sorry. Look at the person sitting next to you.
Speaker: shirley | Listeners: jeff
	Look at her? Okay.
Speaker: abed | Listeners: jeff
	This?
Speaker: jeff | Listeners: abed
	Yeah.
Speaker: jeff | Listeners: group
	I want you to extend to that person the same compassion that you extend to sharks, pencils, and Ben Affleck. I want you to say to that person, "I forgive you."
Speaker: shirley | Listeners: annie
	I forgive you.
Speaker: annie | Listeners: shirley
	I forgive you.
Speaker: troy | Listeners: pierce
	I forgive you.
Speaker: pierce | Listeners: troy
	You little twerp.
Speaker: jeff | Listeners: pierce
	Pierce, I'd like you to say, "I forgive you."
Speaker: shirley | Listeners: jeff
	He didn't say it?
Speaker: pierce | Listeners: troy
	I forgive you.
Speaker: jeff | Listeners: group
	You've just stopped being a study group. You have become something, unstoppable. I hereby pronounce you, a community.
Speaker: shirley | Listeners: group
	Oh, that's nice. I like that.
Speaker: abed | Listeners: jeff
	This isn't like Breakfast Club anymore. Now it's like Stripes or Meatballs. Anything with Bill Murray, really.
Speaker: jeff | Listeners: group
	I agree with Abed that tonight has been very special. And now, if you'll excuse me, I have a dinner engagement with Britta.
Speaker: jeff | Listeners: group
	Britta?
Speaker: britta | Listeners: jeff
	I lied. Thanks for calming everyone down. but since you're not a Spanish tutor, just a lying creep who purposely upset everyone in an attempt to get with me, I'd appreciate it if you left and stopped wasting all of our time.
Speaker: britta | Listeners: group
	Everybody ready?
Speaker: jeff | Listeners: britta
	Fine.
Speaker: jeff | Listeners: group
	And I'm happy to report that one of the benefits of being a lying creep is having all the answers to tomorrow's test. And I'm happy to share them with anyone whose time I've wasted more than they've wasted mine.
Speaker: pierce | Listeners: jeff
	Uh, Jeff, if you have all the answers, why the hell did you start this study group?
Speaker: jeff | Listeners: pierce
	I don't have a study group, Pierce. I made it up.
Speaker: annie | Listeners: jeff
	What about the "Look Left" speech?
Speaker: jeff | Listeners: annie
	Made it up. That's what I do.
Speaker: jeff | Listeners: group
	I make things up, and I got paid a lot of money to do it before I came to this school-shaped toilet. I was a lawyer.
Speaker: group | Listeners: self
	Oh, God.
Speaker: shirley | Listeners: group
	That explains everything.
Speaker: abed | Listeners: jeff
	You know, I thought you were like Bill Murray in any of his films, but you're more like Michael Douglas in any of his films.
Speaker: jeff | Listeners: abed
	Yeah?
Speaker: abed | Listeners: jeff
	Yeah.
Speaker: jeff | Listeners: abed
	Well, you have Asperger's.
Speaker: abed | Listeners: britta
	What did he say?
Speaker: troy | Listeners: self
	"Ass-burger".
Speaker: annie | Listeners: troy
	It's a serious disorder.
Speaker: shirley | Listeners: troy
	It really is.
Speaker: pierce | Listeners: annie shirley
	If it's so serious, why don't they call it meningitis?
Speaker: pierce | Listeners: self
	"Ass-burger".
Speaker: troy | Listeners: pierce
	Burger for your ass.


Speaker: pierce | Listeners: shirley
	you know, i was really moved by your honesty earlier. Particularly the part about your husband Not being able, you know...


Speaker: pierce | Listeners: group
	That's right. Laugh it up. You guys want to know what they're doing?
Speaker: abed | Listeners: pierce
	Yeah.
Speaker: troy | Listeners: pierce
	Sure.
Speaker: pierce | Listeners: group
	Making fun of all of us.
Speaker: pierce | Listeners: jeff
	I heard you with my own ear...noculars.
Speaker: jeff | Listeners: pierce
	Pierce, we are not making fun of you.
Speaker: pierce | Listeners: annie
	Uh-Huh. Calling me "hacky sack" And ripping my--My six pack abs and my moist hair.
Speaker: pierce | Listeners: shirley
	And that face you made? Well, i think it's pretty obviously annie.
Speaker: troy | Listeners: self
	Okay, this is definitely still part of the experiment.
Speaker: jeff | Listeners: pierce
	Pierce, we were not making fun of you.
Speaker: shirley | Listeners: pierce
	Yeah.
Speaker: jeff | Listeners: pierce
	We're making fun britta's boyfriend, vaughan.
Speaker: pierce | Listeners: jeff shirley
	Oh, good. Well, in that case. But if we're gonna do something, let's do it as a team. I will get the ball rolling. Maybe he has a tiny penis.
Speaker: troy | Listeners: group
	Who is this guy?
Speaker: shirley | Listeners: group
	You all have got to see him. Everything's all, "no worries, no worries." And he always says hello three times in a row. Hello, good evening, how are you? And--Here, look! He wrote a poem!
Speaker: group | Listeners: self
	Oh!
Speaker: abed | Listeners: shirley
	Can i read it?
Speaker: jeff | Listeners: shirley
	We shouldn't show that.
Speaker: shirley | Listeners: jeff
	Oh, no, it's fine.


Speaker: britta | Listeners: shirley
	Shirley, you took off your wedding ring
Speaker: shirley | Listeners: britta annie
	Yeah, my husband has been gone for 6 months so I think it's time for me to embrace being single
Speaker: pierce | Listeners: shirley
	Message received
Speaker: annie | Listeners: jeff pierce
	Um, still waiting to hear back from Jeff and Pierce
Speaker: pierce | Listeners: annie
	Oh, I thought I shouted you the response from the phone here. Access email
Speaker: britta | Listeners: jeff
	Are you not going to Annie's party?
Speaker: jeff | Listeners: britta
	Oh, I have a conflict. It conflicts the enjoyment of my life
Speaker: pierce | Listeners: all
	I cannot figure out the voice command part of this thing. It's like my mother
Speaker: phone | Listeners: pierce
	Calling Mother
Speaker: pierce | Listeners: self
	What?


Speaker: pierce | Listeners: shirley
	This is a real barn-burner. God, did i just say cross-burner?
Speaker: shirley | Listeners: pierce
	no, you did not.
Speaker: pierce | Listeners: shirley
	oh, good.


Speaker: pierce | Listeners: group
	you know, if senor chang gets any crazier, He's gonna win one of those grammy awards.
Speaker: annie | Listeners: group
	i've already reported him to the dean. He said they've been trying to fire him for three years, But nobody wants his job.
Speaker: shirley | Listeners: group
	mm-mm, i can't write a 20-page paper. I got a presentation in my marketing class on friday And public speaking gives me the nervous sweats.
Speaker: pierce | Listeners: shirley
	i can help you with that.
Speaker: shirley | Listeners: pierce
	i accept.
Speaker: shirley | Listeners: group
	That's how messed up things are.
Speaker: troy | Listeners: group
	well, we're screwed too. We're three days behind on our biology lab.
Speaker: abed | Listeners: group
	the reason it's taking so long is because troy's afraid--
Speaker: troy | Listeners: abed
	i'm not afraid, abed. I choose not to be around rats because they are unpopular. Same goes for centipedes and lakes.
Speaker: britta | Listeners: group
	there's only one solution. Someone has to go to chang and talk to him.
Speaker: annie | Listeners: group
	i vote we all look at jeff at the same time.
Speaker: jeff | Listeners: group
	in a way, all of you are right. Okay, what was i tuning out?
Speaker: annie | Listeners: jeff
	you have to get chang to call off some of this homework. You're the one with the silver tongue.
Speaker: pierce | Listeners: jeff
	yeah, go tongue chang.
Speaker: jeff | Listeners: group
	guys, what makes you think i can convince chang of anything If i can't even convince you not to make me do it?
Speaker: britta | Listeners: group 
	i guess it sounds crazy.
Speaker: annie | Listeners: group
	oh...
Speaker: troy | Listeners: group
	jeff does raise a good point.
Speaker: pierce | Listeners: group
	i don't get it.
Speaker: troy | Listeners: jeff
	wait, you are convincing!
Speaker: shirley | Listeners: jeff
	you just made us change. you could do it.
Speaker: jeff | Listeners: group
	you want me to risk the "c" That i'm pulling in that psycho's class By putting myself on his radar? I mean, that guy goes any more nuts, He's gonna win a grammy.
Speaker: troy | Listeners: jeff
	you are hilarious.
Speaker: abed | Listeners: group
	that's very funny.
Speaker: shirley | Listeners: group
	he's funny.
Speaker: pierce | Listeners: group
	what is it, the chair?
Speaker: britta | Listeners: jeff
	jeff, how do you think You're gonna keep pulling a "c" in that psycho's class If he keeps assigning this much work?
Speaker: jeff | Listeners: group
	because i have you guys.
Speaker: annie | Listeners: jeff
	well, guess what, handsome hobo. Your gravy train's leavin' the station.
Speaker: troy | Listeners: jeff
	ignore what she's doing. we are serious.
Speaker: jeff | Listeners: group
	fine. i'll do it. But when you find my body, don't believe the suicide note.


Speaker: shirley | Listeners: self
	i believe that, uh, Fusing brownies with the, uh, internet Is going to create the next napster for brownies.
Speaker: pierce | Listeners: shirley
	yawn!
Speaker: shirley | Listeners: pierce
	can't i just write it on cards?
Speaker: pierce | Listeners: shirley
	no. Do you know anybody who reads from cards? No, you don't, and that's why. Also you might consider a darker top.
Speaker: shirley | Listeners: pierce
	note taken.
Speaker: pierce | Listeners: shirley
	oh, and  Don't--don't, uh, lock your knees. Never lock your knees. You know what happens when you lock your knees? You die. Second, When you want to drive home a point, Hand them a sandwich. Try it. hand them a sandwich.
Speaker: shirley | Listeners: pierce
	hand them a sandwich.
Speaker: pierce | Listeners: shirley
	yeah, except you just dropped, uh, the sandwich, As opposed to handing it to them.
Speaker: shirley | Listeners: pierce
	hand them--oh, okay.
Speaker: pierce | Listeners: shirley
	right. so yeah. And try attention-grabbing words to wake up the audience Such as, uh, "multiple orgasm."
Speaker: shirley | Listeners: pierce
	oh, no, no, i don't think that would Really fit into my message. Maybe we should focus, uh, more on, um, uh...
Speaker: pierce | Listeners: shirley
	yeah, and about these filler words of yours. I mean, nobody wants to buy brownies from somebody who says, "um," and "like." I have a method for fixing that. start from the top.
Speaker: shirley | Listeners: pierce
	okay. These brownies are, um--
Speaker: pierce | Listeners: shirley
	uh!
Speaker: shirley | Listeners: pierce
	they, um--
Speaker: pierce | Listeners: shirley
	uh!
Speaker: shirley | Listeners: pierce
	these brownies are... Delicious. They taste like--
Speaker: pierce | Listeners: shirley
	like!
Speaker: shirley | Listeners: pierce
	that's not a filler word.
Speaker: pierce | Listeners: shirley
	whatever, valley girl.


Speaker: pierce | Listeners: shirley
	best closer to a presentation, a nicholson quote. Uh, you take a phrase from one of his films And you tailor it to your product. You can't handle a moist towelette! Something like that, you know? But you can't use that one. that's--that's mine.
Speaker: shirley | Listeners: pierce
	thanks, pierce.
Speaker: pierce | Listeners: shirley
	sure.
Speaker: shirley | Listeners: pierce
	i'm just gonna write it on some cards.
Speaker: pierce | Listeners: shirley
	okay. Just don't let anybody know i was involved.


Speaker: shirley | Listeners: group
	What is going on?
Speaker: troy | Listeners: shirley
	We're trying to get Jeff ready for the fiiiii...iiight.
Speaker: troy | Listeners: jeff
	I couldn't think of another word.
Speaker: jeff | Listeners: troy
	Idiot.
Speaker: jeff | Listeners: shirley
	He meant we were figh... ...ting.
Speaker: jeff | Listeners: troy
	It is hard to think of another word.
Speaker: shirley | Listeners: jeff
	You realize there's no other way for me to take this than as a giant middle finger to the most important day of the year.
Speaker: jeff | Listeners: shirley
	December 10th?
Speaker: shirley | Listeners: group
	It's our Christmas, and I'm having a party. Due to my divorce and my relatives picking sides, this will be the only Christmas party I throw this year. Will you be there, or will I have another family letting me down?
Speaker: pierce | Listeners: shirley
	I told him not to fight. He wouldn't listen. I don't know what that is.
Speaker: shirley | Listeners: jeff
	Jeffrey, I have two boys. And when we have a serious discussion, I find that a brownie helps them to relax. So why do you hate me and Jesus?
Speaker: jeff | Listeners: shirley
	I don't think my brownie's working.
Speaker: shirley | Listeners: jeff
	Please don't do something so ugly on a day so important to me.
Speaker: jeff | Listeners: shirley
	Again, it's December 10th.
Speaker: shirley | Listeners: jeff
	You think religion is stupid?
Speaker: jeff | Listeners: shirley
	No, no. To me, religion is like Paul Rudd. I see the appeal, and I would never take it away from anyone. But I would also never stand in line for it. And look, Shirley, the die has been cast with this crazy bully guy. He picked on Abed, and he corrected my Spanish. So you go to your party, and I'll see you soon.
Speaker: shirley | Listeners: jeff
	Jeffrey, I forbid you from fighting.
Speaker: jeff | Listeners: shirley
	Well, you don't get to. You're not my mom.
Speaker: shirley | Listeners: jeff
	You're right. But if you show up for the fight, don't show up for my party.
Speaker: jeff | Listeners: shirley
	Oh, come on, Shirley, don't be mad.
Speaker: shirley | Listeners: jeff
	I'm not mad. I'm disappointed.
Speaker: jeff | Listeners: shirley
	That's "mom" for mad.


Speaker: troy | Listeners: abed
	You watching another movie in your dorm tonight?
Speaker: abed | Listeners: troy
	Kickpuncher, starring don "the demon" Donaldson as a cyborg cop whose punches have the power of kicks.
Speaker: troy | Listeners: abed
	That sounds awful. I'll bring the popcorn.
Speaker: abed | Listeners: troy
	Cool.
Speaker: shirley | Listeners: abed
	Uh, you... you watch bad movies on purpose?
Speaker: abed | Listeners: shirley
	Yeah. We make fun of 'em.
Speaker: pierce | Listeners: shirley
	Shirley, don't embarrass yourself. I'm sure they don't want to invite a housewife.
Speaker: abed | Listeners: shirley troy pierce
	Actually, if she doesn't mind reinforcing the stereotype, I bet Shirley would have fun talking smack at a movie.
Speaker: abed | Listeners: shirley
	Care to join us?
Speaker: shirley | Listeners: abed
	Usually when a movie's bad, I stop watching, but this sounds college-y.
Speaker: pierce | Listeners: abed
	What time do you want us there?
Speaker: troy | Listeners: pierce
	Pierce, you don't want to watch a cyborg movie in Abed's dorm. You want to lay on your twin bed and think about what you used to be.
Speaker: pierce | Listeners: troy abed shirley
	What? You think I'm too old to make monkeyshines at a picture show? Come on. I'm younger than the three of you put together.


Speaker: pierce | Listeners: all
	Let's get to the movie.
Speaker: pierce | Listeners: shirley
	Oh, I'm sorry, Shirley. I'll wait if you want to serve beverages.
Speaker: shirley | Listeners: pierce
	You gonna be waiting a long-ass time.


Speaker: jeff | Listeners: annie
	Annie... We're sorry. We were worried about your well-being.
Speaker: britta | Listeners: annie
	I guess we feel like we're sort of all a family, and Jeff and I are like your Greendale parents.
Speaker: annie | Listeners: britta
	You're not my mom, Britta. She would never wear boots that go up that High. And what about respecting me as an adult and as a friend?
Speaker: britta | Listeners: annie
	Oh, you want to be treated as an adult and a friend? Try not dating your friend's ex-boyfriend. Find your own man.
Speaker: shirley | Listeners: self
	Oh, my.
Speaker: abed | Listeners: self
	Oh, boy.
Speaker: annie | Listeners: britta
	But you don't like Vaughan.
Speaker: britta | Listeners: annie
	No, I don't, but I also don't like seeing him with anyone else. Ta-da!
Speaker: annie | Listeners: britta
	I asked you if you cared, and you said no.
Speaker: britta | Listeners: annie
	Fine. I cared. I'm a girlie-girl. I like boys, and I don't like it when they're mean to me, and I don't like it when they stop kissing me and start kissing my friends. I'm not that cool. I'm not Juno, okay, homeslice?
Speaker: jeff | Listeners: britta
	This is what it was about for you? You were jealous?
Speaker: britta | Listeners: jeff
	Oh, please, you can't tell me that you weren't jealous that Vaughan had his hippie hands all over your debate/make-out partner.
Speaker: annie | Listeners: britta
	What are you insinuating? I took that kiss for the team.
Speaker: jeff | Listeners: annie
	What?
Speaker: jeff | Listeners: britta
	Yeah, that kiss wasn't for pleasure. It was strategic and joyless.
Speaker: annie | Listeners: jeff
	What?
Speaker: annie | Listeners: britta
	Yeah.
Speaker: troy | Listeners: jeff
	You did get weirdly specific when you were describing Annie's body.
Speaker: jeff | Listeners: troy
	More specific than the stuff you told me about Britta?
Speaker: annie | Listeners: troy
	What?
Speaker: britta | Listeners: troy
	What?
Speaker: shirley | Listeners: group
	Does anyone get specific about me?
Speaker: pierce | Listeners: shirley
	Check your email.
Speaker: shirley | Listeners: pierce
	I'll mark you as spam.
Speaker: pierce | Listeners: shirley
	Who the hell is Pam?
Speaker: abed | Listeners: group
	When you guys first came in, we were as wholesome and healthy as the family in the Brady bunch. And now we're as dysfunctional and incestuous as the cast of the Brady bunch.
Speaker: shirley | Listeners: group
	I agree with abed. This is getting creepy.
Speaker: annie | Listeners: shirley
	No more creepy than when Jeff wears tight jeans and you say, "I'd like to slap those buns on the grill."
Speaker: pierce | Listeners: annie
	What?
Speaker: jeff | Listeners: annie
	What?
Speaker: shirley | Listeners: annie
	First of all, I don't talk like that, and second of all, where I'm from, it's perfectly normal for women to talk about their male friends' backsides. And you don't see me saying anything crazy about abed and Troy's weird little relationship.
Speaker: abed | Listeners: troy
	They're just jealous.
Speaker: troy | Listeners: abed
	They're just jealous.
Speaker: jeff | Listeners: group
	All right, all right, maybe we're not a family. Maybe it's more complicated, because unlike a real family, there's nothing to stop any one of us from looking at any of the others as a sexual prospect.
Speaker: annie | Listeners: group
	Why are we even talking about this?
Speaker: jeff | Listeners: annie
	Because you started having sex with Britta's ex-boyfriend.
Speaker: annie | Listeners: jeff
	What? We haven't even kissed.
Speaker: pierce | Listeners: annie
	That doesn't mean you're not having sex.
Speaker: annie | Listeners: group
	Vaughan told me he would take things as slowly as I wanted. He likes me for who I am, and I like him.
