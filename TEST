Bears have feet.\t| Pierce Troy", " We're the only species on Earth that observes Shark Week. Sharks don't even observe Shark Week, but we do. For the same reason I can pick up this pencil, tell you it's name is Steve, and go like this. And part of you dies just a little bit on the inside, because people can connect with anything.

Shirley has earned our respect, Not as a wife, not as a mother, but as a woman. And don't test her on that, because that thing about the jukebox was way too specific to be improvised. And Troy. Who cares if Troy thinks he's all that? Maybe he is. You think astronauts go to the moon because they hate oxygen? No! They're trying to impress their high-school prom king. And Abed. Abed's a shaman. You ask him to pass the salt, he gives you a bowl of soup, because you know what? Soup is better. Abed is better. You are all better than you think you are. You are just designed not to believe it when you hear it from yourself.\t| Jeff Group", " Soup?\t| Pierce Abed", " I want you to look to the person to your left. Sorry.

You have become something... unstoppable. I hereby pronounce you... a community.\t| Jeff Group", " Oh, that's nice. I like that.\t| Shirley Group", " This isn't like Breakfast Club anymore. Now it's like Stripes or Meatballs. Anything with Bill Murray, really.\t| Abed Jeff", " I agree with Abed that tonight has been very special. And now, if you'll excuse me, I have a dinner engagement with Britta. Britta?\t| Jeff Group", " I lied. Thanks for calming everyone down. but since you're not a Spanish tutor, just a lying creep who purposely upset everyone in an attempt to get with me, I'd appreciate it if you left and stopped wasting all of our time.\t| Britta Jeff", " Everybody ready?\t| Britta Group", " Fine.\t| Jeff Britta", " And I'm happy to report that one of the benefits of being a lying creep is having all the answers to tomorrow's test. And I'm happy to share them with anyone whose time I've wasted more than they've wasted mine.\t| Jeff Group", " Uh, Jeff, if you have all the answers, why the hell did you start this study group?\t| Pierce Jeff", " I don't have a study group, Pierce. I made it up.\t| Jeff Pierce", " - What about the \"Look Left\" speech?\t| Annie Jeff", "- Made it up. That's what I do.\t| Jeff Annie", " I make things up, and I got paid a lot of money to do it before I came to this school-shaped toilet. I was a lawyer.\t| Jeff Group", " - Oh, God.\t| Group", "- That explains everything.\t| Shirley Group", " You know, I thought you were like Bill Murray in any of his films, but you're more like Michael Douglas in any of his films.\t| Abed Jeff", " - Yeah?\t| Jeff Abed", "- Yeah.\t| Abed Jeff", " Well, you have Asperger's.\t| Jeff Abed", " What did he say?\t| Abed Britta", " \"Ass-burger\".\t| Troy", " - It's a serious disorder.\t| Annie Troy", "- It really is.\t| Shirley Troy", " If it's so serious, why don't they call it meningitis?\t| Pierce Annie Shirley", " - \"Ass-burger\".\t| Pierce", "- Burger for your ass.\t| Troy Pierce", " Jeffrey, before you say anything, you may want to think about the gift you've been given.\t| Duncan Jeff", " - An excuse to punch a hippy?\t| Jeff Pierce", "- No. No, not that. An important lesson, my friend. You see, the tools you acquired to survive out there will not help you here at Greendale. What you have, my friend, is a second chance at an honest life.\t| Duncan Jeff", " Why are people trying  to teach me things At a school that has an express tuition aisle? - Give me the keys.\t| Jeff Duncan", "- No, I have to keep your car for-- Don't hit me.

Sometimes, I think I'm doing something wrong.\t| Pierce Jeff", " You keep getting married.\t| Jeff Pierce", " I never looked at it that way.\t| Pierce Jeff", " Shouldn't you guys be studying?\t| Jeff Pierce Troy", " Yeah, things got kind of boring after you left. Let me ask you something. People becloud me for wearing this jacket ever since I got here, but  If I take it off to make them happy, That just makes me weak, right?\t| Troy Jeff", " Listen, it doesn't matter. You lose the jacket to please them, you keep it to piss them off, Either way It's for them. That's what's weak..\t| Jeff Troy", " Wow. You just wrinkled my brain, man.\t| Troy Jeff", " - He's good, isn't he?\t| Pierce Troy", "- He's really good.\t| Troy Pierce", " Shouldn't you be rolling around on a bed covered in test answers?\t| Britta Jeff", " I don't have any of the answers. I'm gonna-- I'm gonna flunk the test.\t| Jeff Group", " You just, like, study for, like, an hour. It's not that hard. You seem pretty smart. You got a sports coat.\t| Troy Jeff", " I am me... Well, the funny thing about being smart is that you can get through most of life without ever having to do any work. So, uh... I'm not really sure how to do that.\t| Jeff Group", " What's going on? Can you guys hear me? Am I deaf? - Can you hear me talking right now?\t| Abed Group", "- Yes.\t| Group Abed", " That's good.\t| Abed Group", " You know what?
