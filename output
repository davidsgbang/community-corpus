hey, man. my name's Jeff. I'm trying to lock down the rest of my schedule Before the deadline. I heard this class was a cakewalk. Are you passing it? Do you like dane cook?	|Jeff Extra	|99
yeah, he's awesome.	|Extra Jeff	|99
so far so good.	|Jeff Extra	|99
death... So-called... Is a thing that makes men weep. And yet a third of life is spent In sleep. Open your textbooks to page 37. Now...close them and throw them away. Throw it away! Throw it away! For those of you who are new, The motto of this class: carpe diem. "seize the day!" No tests! no papers. You want an "a"? Live in... The moment.	|Whitman All	|01
jackpot.	|Jeff	|01
take off your shoes. Quick. take off your shoes. everyone, take your shoes off. Throw them away. Throw them across the room over there. Today, we learn to walk! Get up and walk out the door! This day could be your last!	|Whitman All	|01
You could die in your sleep.	|Whitman Extra	|01
You could get hit by a bus.	|Whitman Extra	|01
You, that mole is raised and dark.	|Whitman Extra	|01
It's not a good combo.	|Whitman Extra	|01
You are new.	|Whitman Jeff	|01
yes, i'm new. But i'll be old too soon. Carpe diem, sir. carpe diem!	|Jeff Whitman	|01
i like it!	|Whitman Jeff	|01
voice command. Voice command. Voice command. Voice command. Voice command! would you please use the buttons?	|Britta Pierce	|02
okay, grandpa.	|Pierce Britta	|02
oh, god bless you, dear.	|Shirley Troy	|02
what's so funny?	|Troy Group	|02
you guys, i found it. the ultimate blow-off class. Professor Whitman. he thinks he's in dead poets society. There's no tests. there's no work. It's just "day seizing." The deadline to enroll is tomorrow. I suggest you all do it.	|Jeff Group	|02
well, some of us are here to actually learn things.	|Annie Jeff	|02
i'm in.	|Troy Jeff	|02
me too. it sounds educational.	|Annie Troy	|02
i'll do it. i love robin williams.	|Shirley Annie Jeff	|02
abed?	|Jeff Abed	|02
not a fan. In every movie, there's an authority figure That gets mad at him for making people laugh.	|Abed Jeff	|02
no, are--are you going to take the class?	|Jeff Abed	|02
oh, can't.	|Abed Jeff	|02
My dad will only pay for classes That will help me run the family restaurant. It's been struggling since 2001. 9/11 was pretty much the 9/11 of the falafel business.	|Abed Group	|02
so your dad has your whole life planned out for you? Are you even interested in falafel?	|Britta Abed	|02
i'm interested in making movies. But my dad says all media's western propaganda That negatively stereotypes arabs.	|Abed Britta	|02
then he should see aladdin. jafar was a bad-ass.	|Troy Group	|02
yes, he was.	|Abed Troy	|02
abed.	|Britta Abed	|02
mm.	|Abed Britta	|02
how much does a film class cost?	|Britta Abed	|02
$70.	|Abed Britta	|02
Britta.	|Jeff Britta	|02
Jeff.	|Britta Jeff	|02
Britta.	|Jeff Britta	|02
isn't abed's dad a hardcore muslim?  They're not as understanding as christians. You can get your head cut off with a salami sword.	|Shirley Britta	|02
Shirley! That's the most racist thing i've ever heard.	|Annie Shirley	|02
Pierce will beat that in one minute.	|Jeff Annie	|02
this is really nice of you.	|Abed Britta	|02
the memo says "for dreams."	|Abed Group	|02
oh!	|Group Abed	|02
you guys, are we going to study spanish Or keep getting involved in each other's personal lives?	|Jeff Group	|02
hey, Troy sneezes like a girl.	|Jeff Troy	|02
and how about i pound you like a boy? That didn't come out right.	|Troy Jeff	|02
why don't you all just leave him alone With his cute little baby sneezes.	|Shirley Group	|02
you're not my mother.	|Troy Shirley	|02
she's not?	|Pierce Troy	|02
29 seconds.	|Jeff Group	|02
what's your name?	|Whitman Shirley	|03
my name is Shirley Bennett.	|Shirley Whitman	|03
Shirley, you get an "a"...	|Whitman Shirley	|03
oh.	|Shirley Whitman	|03
if you can tell me why you are here at greendale.	|Whitman Shirley	|03
what'd i tell you? Okay, but, uh, never again.	|Jeff Troy	|04
Shirley?	|Whitman Shirley	|03
to get a degree in business So i can sell my baked goods and whatnot on the internet.	|Shirley Whitman	|03
why...are you here?	|Whitman Shirley	|03
to get a degree in business So i can sell my baked goods and whatnot on the internet.	|Shirley Whitman	|03
why are you here?	|Whitman Shirley	|03
because i wasted 15 years of my life on a man Who left me with nothing but stretch marks And a foggy memory of two bland orgasms. And now it's time to get what's mine.	|Shirley Whitman	|03
day seized. Only when we stop stopping our lives Can we begin to start starting them. Ms. Edison here, for example, would rather write About what happens to other people Than live what is happening to her.	|Whitman All	|03
i thought there might be a quiz.	|Annie Whitman	|05
well, here's a quiz for you. Why did the pretty young girl die alone Surrounded by sweater-wearing cats Who are trained to use human toilets?	|Whitman Annie	|05
Get up on your desk. Come on. stand on your desk. Up on your desk. She made it! ha ha! Everyone stand on your desks! Up, up, up, up, up! come on. Rise, rise, rise above the programming. All your lives you were told don't stand on your desks. Well, why not?	|Whitman All	|05
ooh! ooh! oh, heaven. My.	|Shirley Extra	|05
she's okay. Go to the nurse. seize the day.	|Whitman All	|05
you know, i was really moved by your honesty earlier. Particularly the part about your husband Not being able, you know...	|Pierce Shirley	|06
your homework. ah. I want you to swim in a lake And tell ten people that you love them.	|Whitman All	|05
Mr. winger, can i have a word, please?	|Whitman Jeff	|05
are you okay.	|Annie Extra	|05
oh, maybe i'm not.	|Extra Annie	|05
hi. Mr. winger, i like to think that every life That passes through this class is changed. But every year, there's always one cocky opportunist Who's just here to coast and grab an easy "a."	|Whitman Jeff	|07
oh, yeah. his name's Pierce. I-i can talk to him for you.	|Jeff Whitman	|07
It's actually you, mr. winger. You have no intention of seizing the day.	|Whitman Jeff	|07
what? listen, i-i have never lived Until i met you. I-i love you. Oh, there's one down. nine to go. Not that i need the grade or even want it!	|Jeff Whitman	|07
well, i'm glad to hear it. Because if you don't genuinely seize the day Before the end of the week, Then you will be seizing an "f" for the semester.	|Whitman Jeff	|07
you... This is no way to teach accounting!	|Jeff Whitman	|07
i have to plan in advance How to prove that i live in the moment. I mean, i'd rather take an actual class, But now it's too late to drop or add.	|Jeff Britta	|08
it is not fair how hard it is for you to cheat here.	|Britta Jeff	|08
hey, how's it going? How's your film class, buddy?	|Britta Abed	|09
it's cool. our first assignment is a documentary. They're like real movies, but with ugly people. I'm learning a lot.	|Abed Britta	|09
that is so wonderful. Some people don't like getting involved In other's lives. I think it's great.	|Britta Abed Jeff	|09
hey, if you're making a documentary About Britta patting herself on the back, You're gonna need a backup battery.	|Jeff Abed Britta	|09
actually, i'm doing a movie about my dad.	|Abed Jeff	|09
that is brilliant. How did he react to you signing up for the film class? that part hasn't happened yet. here he comes.	|Britta Jeff	|09
hey! you want to get involved in my family's business?	|AbedDAD	|09
holy...war.	|Jeff	|09
where do i find mr. Britta?	|AbedDAD Jeff	|09
i'm mr. Britta. That's right. i'm a woman with rights. And you can see my whole face.	|Britta AbedDAD	|09
oh, i get it! Because i'm arab, i must hate women. Let me tell you something, i love women. But i'm getting a major b-word vibe from you.	|AbedDAD Britta	|09
wow, i can't believe i missed out On getting involved in this.	|Jeff AbedDAD	|09
you go host american idol And you stop messing with my son. He's a special boy. I raise him, okay? you don't raise him.	|AbedDAD Britta	|09
raising him means letting him follow his dreams.	|Britta AbedDAD	|09
dreams are for sleeping.	|AbedDAD Britta	|09
you don't know that.	|Britta AbedDAD	|09
it's clinically proven.	|AbedDAD Britta	|09
so's polio.	|Britta AbedDAD	|09
you lost me!	|AbedDAD Britta	|09
abed wants to study film.	|Britta AbedDAD	|09
wait, what is he saying?	|Britta Abed	|09
he says "we're leaving."	|Abed Britta	|09
tell him that you want to stay and study film.	|Britta Abed	|09
i don't think i'm really in the scene.	|Abed Britta	|09
see, it was hard enough to talk to him before. Now we have this between us!	|AbedDAD Britta Jeff Abed	|09
Let's go!	|AbedDAD Abed	|09
hey! hey!	|Britta AbedDAD	|09
hey, don't touch me!	|AbedDAD Britta	|09
guys, guys, stop it. stop it.	|Jeff Britta AbedDAD	|09
you don't touch me!	|AbedDAD Britta	|09
Britta back up. stop.	|Jeff Britta	|09
Sir, you have a right to your faith And your family's privacy. But abed is an adult and a u.s. citizen.	|Jeff AbedDAD	|09
Right?	|Jeff Abed	|09
yeah.	|Abed Jeff	|09
and he has the right to stay.	|Jeff AbedDAD	|09
fine. you want to raise him, you raise him. I'm out!	|AbedDAD Jeff	|09
wait, what?	|Jeff AbedDAD	|09
you know, i had a father like you. And the day i finally cut myself loose is the day i finally started being happy.	|Britta AbedDAD	|09
well, that went well.	|Jeff Abed	|09
i'll have to make some adjustments to my film. Jeff, i think you should play the role of my father.	|Abed Jeff	|09
i don't want to be your father.	|Jeff Abed	|09
that's perfect. you already know your lines.	|Abed Jeff	|09
What? Why are you dressed like an '80s rapist?	|Britta Jeff	|10
professor Whitman comes by here every morning And i need him to see me celebrating life. What's all that?	|Jeff Britta	|10
i am calculating abed's expenses For the semester. You know, there's books. there's meals. He's renting that camera. And, you know, he needs a little spending money.	|Britta Jeff	|10
um, all money is spending money.	|Jeff Britta	|10
Britta, um, it's amazing what you're doing for abed. I mean, a lot of people talk a good game. But you, you follow through. love you.	|Shirley Britta	|10
Shirley, thank you. Bet that doesn't happen to you a lot.	|Britta Shirley	|10
happened yesterday. Shirley's just doing her homework.	|Jeff Britta	|10
hillary, thank you for getting people coffee. I love you.	|Shirley Extra	|10
abed, how's it going, buddy?	|Britta Abed	|11
good. my film is coming together.	|Abed Britta	|11
Cool tie, Jeff. Are you wearing that Because you're playing the role of my dad, Or is it really christmas?	|Abed Jeff	|11
definitely christmas.	|Jeff Abed	|11
is that a new camera?	|Britta Abed	|11
yeah.	|Abed Britta	|11
It's more expensive, But it lets me adjust really specific settings That most people don't notice or think about.	|Abed Britta	|11
Hi, i would like a latte.	|Abed Extra	|11
And, Jeff, let me get you something.	|Abed Jeff	|11
i'm okay.	|Jeff Abed	|11
oh, come on. i got you.	|Abed Jeff	|11
no, really. i don't need anything.	|Jeff Abed	|11
no, really. you're insulting me. Look at all this cash.	|Abed Jeff	|11
okay, i will get a small, black coffee.	|Jeff Abed	|12
boo. an ordinary coffee for an ordinary life.	|Whitman Jeff	|12
good morning, professor Whitman.	|Jeff Whitman	|12
sorry, mr. winger, these won't cut it.	|Whitman Jeff	|12
shazbot!	|Jeff	|12
i shall have... A birthday cake!	|Whitman Extra	|12
i've seen men in your situation, Troy. No, those are both for me. You were on top of the world before And now no one gives a rat's ass. I can help you with your image. First, lose the jacket. You look like a high school bitch. But more importantly, it's your sneeze. When i was a ceo, I had an array of masculine sneezes That asserted dominance. You know, like, the explosive, Shock-the-room-into-silence sneeze. Or the draw-them-in sneeze. You know... And maybe i wouldn't sneeze because i'm in control. You could even use a sneeze to drive home a point even. Like, i think-- i think the cubs Are going to win it all this year. What do you think?	|Pierce Troy	|13
tell me more.	|Troy Pierce	|13
it's showtime.	|Jeff	|14
Hey, everybody. good morning. Good morning, sir. Good morning, greendale! hi! good morning! Watch the kite. uh-oh. Mind if i get a chance? oh! Look at this. one foot. Thanks, you guys. bring it in here. Nice. thank you so much, you guys. That was really fun.	|Jeff All	|14
sloppy. And considering the age of these girls, Unwittingly creepy.	|Whitman Jeff	|14
damn it.	|Jeff Whitman	|14
Beat it.	|Jeff Extra	|14
Professor, will you look at the amount of work That i'm putting into this? I mean, throw me a bone!	|Jeff Whitman	|14
had i not already cried at the sunrise this morning, I would be weeping right now.	|Whitman Jeff	|14
what does that mean?	|Jeff Whitman	|14
what do you mean, Jeff? What does your life mean? How long does it take you in the morning To--to make it look like you have bed head? How many sweat pants, sport jacket combos did you try Before you found the one that said "i don't care"? Seize the day, Jeff, for real. Go running naked in a hailstorm, Kiss a girl in the middle of the day, Fly a kite, but do it for yourself. Or you won't just fail my class, You'll fail life.	|Whitman Jeff	|14
thank you.	|Britta Whitman	|14
That guy's really got your number.	|Britta Jeff	|15
drop the flower.	|Jeff Britta	|15
look, i really need to talk to you about abed. I went by his film class today. he wasn't there. He's cutting. I want to know why he would do something like that.	|Britta Jeff	|15
ask him.	|Jeff Britta	|15
every time i try to ask him about it, He just keeps filming me and telling me That i'm playing the role of his mother.	|Britta Jeff	|15
abed is not normal. That's what you bought When you intentionally tangled yourself in his life.	|Jeff Britta	|15
look, will you just-- will you please talk to him?	|Britta Jeff	|15
i've got problems of my own! I'm out here trying to seize a day!	|Jeff Britta	|15
What in the hell? Is he gonna kill us?	|Jeff Britta	|15
thanks for the pizza, abed. i was starving.	|Troy Abed	|16
yeah, it's nice. like a--like a picnic.	|Shirley Abed	|16
or a family dinner.	|Pierce Abed	|16
it's a study group and a pizza. Let's not get carried away.	|Jeff Group	|16
so, abed, how's film class?	|Jeff Abed	|16
good.	|Abed Jeff	|16
yeah? did you go to class today?	|Jeff Abed	|16
not really.	|Abed Jeff	|16
not really. Well, Britta's paying for those classes. Don't you think maybe you should go?	|Jeff Abed	|16
i was shooting my movie.	|Abed Jeff	|16
yeah, but your movie's for class.	|Britta Abed	|16
my movie's more important.	|Abed Britta	|16
well, ooh la la.	|Britta Abed	|16
someone order seven lattes?	|Extra Group	|16
i got that.	|Abed Extra	|16
no, you don't got it. I got it, abed. i got everything. What is wrong with you? All i want to do is take care of you. I know you're not stupid. are you doing this on purpose? Why won't you answer me?	|Britta Extra	|16
'cause this is the scene where you leave.	|Abed Britta	|16
you better believe it.	|Britta Abed	|16
Britta.	|Jeff Abed	|16
what do you think, dad?	|Abed Jeff	|16
i think you are really weird, abed. And i think the wrong person just left.	|Jeff Abed	|16
perfect. that's a wrap.	|Abed Group	|16
that guy was your dad?	|Extra Abed	|16
hey.	|Jeff Britta	|17
hey. You don't really have tickets for ravi shankar, do you?	|Britta Jeff	|17
i lied to get you here Because it's time to communicate.	|Jeff Britta	|17
communicate. have you met abed?	|Britta Jeff	|17
it's not the two of you that need to talk.	|Jeff Britta	|17
hey, wait a minute, where's weezer?	|AbedDAD Jeff	|17
they're coming.	|Jeff AbedDAD	|17
All right, now, the only reason Why this whole mess got started Is because both of you wanted the best for abed. And i think the lesson we can all take away from this Is that everyone should always do Whatever they want and leave each other out of it.	|Jeff AbedDAD Britta	|17
is that your take? let me give you mine. You and your pillow-lipped girlfriend Got all up in my stuff because you wanted to be cowboys And then you turned chicken when you found out It will take more than speeches and guided missiles.	|AbedDAD Jeff Britta	|17
interesting. hadn't seen the iraq metaphor, but--	|Jeff AbedDAD	|17
what iraq metaphor? I am talking about your speeches And her guided--	|AbedDAD Jeff	|17
got it!	|Jeff AbedDAD	|17
The point is is that Britta is sorry, right?	|Jeff Britta	|17
wrong.	|Britta Jeff	|17
crap.	|Jeff	|17
abed may not be a great filmmaker, But that doesn't mean that he wants to make falafel. You need to let him make his own decisions.	|Britta AbedDAD	|17
make his own decisions? Have you met abed? you know who he is?	|AbedDAD Britta	|17
guys.	|Jeff Britta AbedDAD	|17
yes.	|Britta AbedDAD	|17
guys!	|Jeff Britta AbedDAD	|17
he loves--	|AbedDAD Britta	|17
i'm finished.	|Abed Jeff Britta AbedDAD	|18
Britta, Jeff, dad.	|Abed Jeff Britta AbedDAD	|18
how's it going, buddy?	|Britta Abed	|18
i don't want to be your father. I think you are weird, abed.	|Jeff Abed	|18
okay, look, i need to talk to you about abed.	|Britta Jeff	|18
he's not normal.	|Jeff Britta	|18
what is wrong with you? All i want to do is take care of you. Why will you not answer me?	|Britta Abed	|18
what do you think, dad?	|Abed Jeff	|18
i think you are weird, abed. And i think the wrong person just left.	|Jeff Abed	|18
it's not exactly citizen kane.	|Jeff Britta	|18
i feel a little out of the loop here.	|Britta Jeff	|18
that feeling is called the joy of freedom.	|Jeff Britta	|18
my son is hard to understand. If making movies help him be understood, Then i pay for the class.	|AbedDAD Jeff Britta	|18
i made this all happen.	|Britta Jeff	|18
with falafel as a fallback.	|AbedDAD Jeff Britta	|18
abed.	|Britta Abed	|19
yeah.	|Abed Britta	|19
did you do all of that to me on purpose? That's not a very nice way to treat your friends.	|Britta Abed	|19
well, Britta, it isn't called friend business, It's called show business.	|Abed Britta	|19
he's smoking.	|Britta Jeff	|19
honey, let him leave the nest.	|Jeff Britta	|19
get your hand off my knee.	|Britta Jeff	|19
sorry.	|Jeff Britta	|19
god--god bless you. god bless you.	|Shirley Troy	|20
thank you.	|Troy Shirley	|20
for someone who doesn't like getting involved, Well, i owe you.	|Britta Jeff	|21
you owe me. That cannot be comfortable for you.	|Jeff Britta	|21
hey, um, you should kiss me right now.	|Britta Jeff	|21
day seized!	|Whitman Jeff	|21
we're even.	|Britta Jeff	|21
"a" plus, winger. I know a life-changing kiss when i see one. Wowee! ha ha!	|Whitman Jeff	|21
yeah. fooled you.	|Jeff Britta	|21
am I krumping?	|Abed Troy	|22
no.	|Troy Abed	|22
am I krumping?	|Abed Troy	|22
no.	|Troy Abed	|22
am I krumping now?	|Abed Troy	|22
no.	|Troy Abed	|22
am I krumping now?	|Abed Troy	|22
No! This is krumping.	|Abed Troy	|22
We are krumping.	|Troy Jeff	|22
No you are not	|Jeff Troy	|22

		what does that mean?

	extra

		hey, man. my name's Jeff. I'm trying to lock down the rest of my schedule Before the deadline. I heard this class was a cakewalk. Are you passing it? Do you like dane cook?

		so far so good.

		Beat it.

	self

		jackpot.

		holy...war.

		shazbot!

		it's showtime.

		crap.

	troy

		hey, Troy sneezes like a girl.

		what'd i tell you? Okay, but, uh, never again.

		No you are not

	abed

		abed?

		no, are--are you going to take the class?

		hey, if you're making a documentary About Britta patting herself on the back, You're gonna need a backup battery.

		Right?

		well, that went well.

		i don't want to be your father.

		definitely christmas.

		i'm okay.

		no, really. i don't need anything.

		okay, i will get a small, black coffee.

		so, abed, how's film class?

		yeah? did you go to class today?

		not really. Well, Britta's paying for those classes. Don't you think maybe you should go?

		Britta.

		i think you are really weird, abed. And i think the wrong person just left.

		i don't want to be your father. I think you are weird, abed.

		i think you are weird, abed. And i think the wrong person just left.

	annie

		Pierce will beat that in one minute.

	britta

		Britta.

		Britta.

		i have to plan in advance How to prove that i live in the moment. I mean, i'd rather take an actual class, But now it's too late to drop or add.

		hey, if you're making a documentary About Britta patting herself on the back, You're gonna need a backup battery.

		guys, guys, stop it. stop it.

		Britta back up. stop.

		professor Whitman comes by here every morning And i need him to see me celebrating life. What's all that?

		um, all money is spending money.

		happened yesterday. Shirley's just doing her homework.

		drop the flower.

		ask him.

		abed is not normal. That's what you bought When you intentionally tangled yourself in his life.

		i've got problems of my own! I'm out here trying to seize a day!

		What in the hell? Is he gonna kill us?

		hey.

		i lied to get you here Because it's time to communicate.

		it's not the two of you that need to talk.

		All right, now, the only reason Why this whole mess got started Is because both of you wanted the best for abed. And i think the lesson we can all take away from this Is that everyone should always do Whatever they want and leave each other out of it.

		The point is is that Britta is sorry, right?

		guys.

		guys!

		he's not normal.

		it's not exactly citizen kane.

		that feeling is called the joy of freedom.

		honey, let him leave the nest.

		sorry.

		you owe me. That cannot be comfortable for you.

		yeah. fooled you.

	abeddad

		wow, i can't believe i missed out On getting involved in this.

		guys, guys, stop it. stop it.

		Sir, you have a right to your faith And your family's privacy. But abed is an adult and a u.s. citizen.

		and he has the right to stay.

		wait, what?

		they're coming.

		All right, now, the only reason Why this whole mess got started Is because both of you wanted the best for abed. And i think the lesson we can all take away from this Is that everyone should always do Whatever they want and leave each other out of it.

		interesting. hadn't seen the iraq metaphor, but--

		got it!

		guys.

		guys!

		abed wants to study film.

		hey! hey!

		you know, i had a father like you. And the day i finally cut myself loose is the day i finally started being happy.

	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: abed

	Speaker: whitman	Listeners: jeff
boo. an ordinary coffee for an ordinary life.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: whitman
good morning, professor Whitman.
	Speaker: whitman	Listeners: jeff
sorry, mr. winger, these won't cut it.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: self
shazbot!
	Speaker: whitman	Listeners: extra
i shall have... A birthday cake!



	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: troy
i've seen men in your situation, Troy. No, those are both for me. You were on top of the world before And now no one gives a rat's ass. I can help you with your image. First, lose the jacket. You look like a high school bitch. But more importantly, it's your sneeze. When i was a ceo, I had an array of masculine sneezes That asserted dominance. You know, like, the explosive, Shock-the-room-into-silence sneeze. Or the draw-them-in sneeze. You know... And maybe i wouldn't sneeze because i'm in control. You could even use a sneeze to drive home a point even. Like, i think-- i think the cubs Are going to win it all this year. What do you think?
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: pierce
tell me more.



	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: self
it's showtime.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: all
Hey, everybody. good morning. Good morning, sir. Good morning, greendale! hi! good morning! Watch the kite. uh-oh. Mind if i get a chance? oh! Look at this. one foot. Thanks, you guys. bring it in here. Nice. thank you so much, you guys. That was really fun.
	Speaker: whitman	Listeners: jeff
sloppy. And considering the age of these girls, Unwittingly creepy.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: whitman
damn it.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: extra
Beat it.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: whitman
Professor, will you look at the amount of work That i'm putting into this? I mean, throw me a bone!
	Speaker: whitman	Listeners: jeff
had i not already cried at the sunrise this morning, I would be weeping right now.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: whitman
what does that mean?
	Speaker: whitman	Listeners: jeff
what do you mean, Jeff? What does your life mean? How long does it take you in the morning To--to make it look like you have bed head? How many sweat pants, sport jacket combos did you try Before you found the one that said "i don't care"? Seize the day, Jeff, for real. Go running naked in a hailstorm, Kiss a girl in the middle of the day, Fly a kite, but do it for yourself. Or you won't just fail my class, You'll fail life.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: whitman
thank you.



	Speaker: britta	Listeners: jeff
That guy's really got your number.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: britta
drop the flower.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: jeff
look, i really need to talk to you about abed. I went by his film class today. he wasn't there. He's cutting. I want to know why he would do something like that.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: britta
ask him.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: jeff
every time i try to ask him about it, He just keeps filming me and telling me That i'm playing the role of his mother.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: britta
abed is not normal. That's what you bought When you intentionally tangled yourself in his life.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: jeff
look, will you just-- will you please talk to him?
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: britta
i've got problems of my own! I'm out here trying to seize a day!
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: britta
What in the hell? Is he gonna kill us?



	Speaker: troy	Listeners: abed
thanks for the pizza, abed. i was starving.
	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: abed
yeah, it's nice. like a--like a picnic.
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: abed
or a family dinner.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: group
it's a study group and a pizza. Let's not get carried away.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: abed
so, abed, how's film class?
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: jeff
good.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: abed
yeah? did you go to class today?
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: jeff
not really.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: abed
not really. Well, Britta's paying for those classes. Don't you think maybe you should go?
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: jeff
i was shooting my movie.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: abed
yeah, but your movie's for class.
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: britta
my movie's more important.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: abed
well, ooh la la.
	Speaker: extra	Listeners: group
someone order seven lattes?
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: extra
i got that.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: extra
no, you don't got it. I got it, abed. i got everything. What is wrong with you? All i want to do is take care of you. I know you're not stupid. are you doing this on purpose? Why won't you answer me?
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: britta
'cause this is the scene where you leave.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: abed
you better believe it.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: abed
Britta.
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: jeff
what do you think, dad?
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: abed
i think you are really weird, abed. And i think the wrong person just left.
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: group
perfect. that's a wrap.
	Speaker: extra	Listeners: abed
that guy was your dad?



	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: britta
hey.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: jeff
hey. You don't really have tickets for ravi shankar, do you?
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: britta
i lied to get you here Because it's time to communicate.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: jeff
communicate. have you met abed?
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: britta
it's not the two of you that need to talk.
	Speaker: abeddad	Listeners: jeff
hey, wait a minute, where's weezer?
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: abeddad
they're coming.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: abeddad britta
All right, now, the only reason Why this whole mess got started Is because both of you wanted the best for abed. And i think the lesson we can all take away from this Is that everyone should always do Whatever they want and leave each other out of it.
	Speaker: abeddad	Listeners: jeff britta
is that your take? let me give you mine. You and your pillow-lipped girlfriend Got all up in my stuff because you wanted to be cowboys And then you turned chicken when you found out It will take more than speeches and guided missiles.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: abeddad
interesting. hadn't seen the iraq metaphor, but--
	Speaker: abeddad	Listeners: jeff
what iraq metaphor? I am talking about your speeches And her guided--
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: abeddad
got it!
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: britta
The point is is that Britta is sorry, right?
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: jeff
wrong.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: self
crap.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: abeddad
abed may not be a great filmmaker, But that doesn't mean that he wants to make falafel. You need to let him make his own decisions.
	Speaker: abeddad	Listeners: britta
make his own decisions? Have you met abed? you know who he is?
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: britta abeddad
guys.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: abeddad
yes.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: britta abeddad
guys!
	Speaker: abeddad	Listeners: britta
he loves--



	Speaker: abed	Listeners: jeff britta abeddad
i'm finished.
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: jeff britta abeddad
Britta, Jeff, dad.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: abed
how's it going, buddy?
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: abed
i don't want to be your father. I think you are weird, abed.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: jeff
okay, look, i need to talk to you about abed.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: britta
he's not normal.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: abed
what is wrong with you? All i want to do is take care of you. Why will you not answer me?
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: jeff
what do you think, dad?
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: abed
i think you are weird, abed. And i think the wrong person just left.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: britta
it's not exactly citizen kane.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: jeff
i feel a little out of the loop here.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: britta
that feeling is called the joy of freedom.
	Speaker: abeddad	Listeners: jeff britta
my son is hard to understand. If making movies help him be understood, Then i pay for the class.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: jeff
i made this all happen.
	Speaker: abeddad	Listeners: jeff britta
with falafel as a fallback.



	Speaker: britta	Listeners: abed
abed.
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: britta
yeah.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: abed
did you do all of that to me on purpose? That's not a very nice way to treat your friends.
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: britta
well, Britta, it isn't called friend business, It's called show business.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: jeff
he's smoking.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: britta
honey, let him leave the nest.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: jeff
get your hand off my knee.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: britta
sorry.



	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: troy
god--god bless you. god bless you.
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: shirley
thank you.



	Speaker: britta	Listeners: jeff
for someone who doesn't like getting involved, Well, i owe you.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: britta
you owe me. That cannot be comfortable for you.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: jeff
hey, um, you should kiss me right now.
	Speaker: whitman	Listeners: jeff

	Speaker: britta	Listeners: jeff

	Speaker: whitman	Listeners: jeff
