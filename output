	Speaker: dean	Listeners: self
Good morning. How do we turn this off?  Mother, you think you can come and help me turn it off? How do we turn this off? Can you help me with this? Oh, thank you, thank you so much. I didn't mean to snap. uh, good morning. Many of you are halfway through your first week here at greendale and as your dean, i thought i would share a few thoughts of wisdom and inspiration. What is community college? Well, you've heard all kinds of things. You've heard it's "loser college for remedial teens, 20-something dropouts, middle-age divorcees, and old people keeping their minds active as they circle the drain of eternity." That's what you heard. However, i wish you luck! Okay, you know-- uh-oh. Okay, there's more to this speech. There's actually a middle card that is missing. Can we all look around our immediate areas, 'cause i really wanted to--


	Speaker: abed	Listeners: jeff
i'm only half-arabic, actually. My dad is palestinian. He's a u.s. citizen. He's not a threat to national security or anything. A lot of people want to know that after they meet him, because he has an angry energy. But not, like, angry at america. Just angry at my mom for leaving him. Although she did leave because he was angry and he was angry because she's american. My name's Abed, by the way.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: abed
Abed, nice to know you and then meet you in that order. Now about that question that i had--
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: jeff
oh, uh, 5 after 11:00 when you asked.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: abed
Abed?
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: jeff
yeah?
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: abed
what's the deal with the hot girl from spanish class? I can't find a road in there.
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: jeff
well, i only talked to her once While she was borrowing a pencil, but, Her name is Britta, she's 28, birthday in october, She has two older brothers and one of 'em Works with children who have a disorder I might want to look up. Oh, and she thinks she's gonna flunk Tomorrow's test, so she really needs to focus So she's sorry if that makes her seem cold.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: abed
holy crap. Abed, I see your value now.
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: jeff
that's the nicest thing anyone's ever said to me.


	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: duncan
If these guys knew you like I did they would have given you a small office.
	Speaker: duncan	Listeners: jeff
Jeff Winger! Genius at law.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: duncan
you got to stop saying that.
	Speaker: duncan	Listeners: jeff
i will never do that. sit down I still cannot figure out how you gonna join September the 11th with my DUI, that alone, why that helped.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: duncan
Well, 2002 was a simple time.
	Speaker: duncan	Listeners: jeff
So what is my lawyer doing here?
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: duncan
i'm a student.
	Speaker: duncan	Listeners: jeff
well, that cannot be an inspiring journey.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: duncan
uh, i am in a bit of a jam. The state bar has suspended my license. They found out my college degree Was less than legitimate.
	Speaker: duncan	Listeners: jeff
i thought you had a bachelor's from columbia.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: duncan
now i have to get one from america. and it can't be an email attachment.
	Speaker: duncan	Listeners: jeff
well, you've picked a fine school.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: duncan
yes, and i'm hoping that our friendship Will yield certain advantages. You know, academic guidance,
	Speaker: duncan	Listeners: jeff
yes.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: duncan
moral support, Every answer to every test For every one of the classes that i'm taking. Here's my schedule.
	Speaker: duncan	Listeners: jeff
no. Now, Jeff, just by asking that, You have insulted the integrity of this entire institution.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: duncan
okay. Duncan, you, did seem less into integrity The day that i convinced 12 of yours peers that when you made that u-turn on the freeway And tried to order chalupas from the emergency call box, That your only real crime was loving america.
	Speaker: duncan	Listeners: jeff
Well, I do love America, I do love it, very much. I love chalupas. But, i'll look into it. 
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: duncan
thank you. Duncan, you are a good man.
	Speaker: duncan	Listeners: jeff
Jeff, are you familiar with the adage, "cheaters never prosper"?
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: duncan
No, and if i wanted to learn something, I wouldn't have come to community college.

Britta invited me. is that cool?

there you go. Oh, hey, here. Put your contact info down right there. That's right.
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: jeff britta

	Speaker: britta	Listeners: abed
we are in a library.
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: jeff britta
yeah. i'm sure we've each got an issue balled up inside of us  that would make us cry if we talked about it.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: abed
do you have something balled up inside of you?
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: jeff
well, i got a little doozy in the chamber if things get emotional.
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: jeff britta
Oh. hey, text message. Let's give this bad boy a read.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: abed
it's probably just for your eyes.
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: jeff britta
I've never got one of these
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: abed
Well, it's just, You probably,  it's probably just for your eyes.
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: jeff britta
"say you have to pee. i need to talk to you."
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: britta
"say you have to pee."
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: abed
that is weird.
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: jeff
"say you have to pee. I need to talk to you."
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: abed
do you have to pee?
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: jeff
no.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: abed
hmm.
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: jeff
that's so weird.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: abed
well, i'm stumped. That's very creepy. That's very creepy.
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: jeff
does it say you have to pee?
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: abed
no, it's just someone With a misguided grasp of abbreviation.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: abed britta
I just need five minutes, you guys, So go ahead and study all the verbs,in spanish.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: abed
Abed,
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: britta
Yeah?
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: abed
What's your read on that guy?
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: britta
You look like Elisabeth Shue.


	Speaker: duncan	Listeners: jeff
Act natural, pretend you are watching the athletic proceedings.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: duncan
I couldn't stop watching them. There's a guy going for the track, that's older than the game of poker. He's kinda cracking.
	Speaker: duncan	Listeners: jeff
suppose i was to say to you It was possible to get those test answers?
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: duncan
i would say, "go for that," And could have said so in a text.
	Speaker: duncan	Listeners: jeff
i'm asking you if you know the difference Between right and wrong.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: duncan
i discovered at a very early age That if i talk long enough, I could make anything right or wrong. So either i'm god or truth is relative. And in either case, booyah.
	Speaker: duncan	Listeners: jeff
oh, interesting. It's just the average person has a much harder time saying, "booyah," to moral relativism.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: duncan
duncan, you don't have to play shrink  To protect your pride. I accept. you're chicken.
	Speaker: duncan	Listeners: jeff
Are you trying to use reverse psychology on a psychologist?
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: duncan
No, I'm just using regular psychology on a spineless, British twit.
	Speaker: duncan	Listeners: jeff
i'm a professor. you can't talk to me that way.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: duncan
a six-year-old girl could talk to you that way.
	Speaker: duncan	Listeners: jeff
yes, because that would be adorable!
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: duncan
No, because you're a five-year-old girl And there's a pecking order.
	Speaker: duncan	Listeners: jeff
fine! i'll do it!
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: duncan
thank you.
	Speaker: duncan	Listeners: jeff
yeah, pleasure. Bye! Yes! good! Why am i still shouting? I'm drawing attention to myself.


	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: britta abed
you guys aren't gonna believe this, But the rest of the group, Is here.
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: jeff
are you the board-certified tutor?
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: jeff
that means you do my homework, right, Seacrest?
	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: jeff
i need to call my babysitter If we're gon' be later than 10:00.
	Speaker: annie	Listeners: jeff
what board certifies a tutor?
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: abed
where's Britta?
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: jeff
not sure. But i invited more people from spanish class. Is that cool? 
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: abed
it's the coolest.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: group
I'm gonna go to the bathroom And bring my jacket, wallet, and keys with me In case there's a fire.
	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: group
should we go with him?
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: group
i'm leaving my homework with slumdog millionaire over here.
	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: troy
that's borderline racist, i think.


	Speaker: britta	Listeners: jeff
and busted.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: britta
uh, listen.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: jeff
now you know. I'm a smoker.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: britta
yeah, but they're filtered, so that makes them safe.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: jeff
you ready to get started? Looks like the rest of your group showed up.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: britta
yeah, not mine, actually. I think Abed took out a page on craigslist. And i was trained never to say this, But i think that group may be untutorable.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: jeff
oh, really?
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: britta
so why don't you and i go study over--
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: jeff
dinner?
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: britta
or drinks.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: jeff
i think, actually, we should prioritize here And study first and then go to dinner. And if they really prove to be untutorable, we'll slip out early.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: self
oh,they will be, untutorable.


	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: group
all right. Look at this crew. All ready to study all night.
	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: group
well, i can stay at least till 10:00.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: group
but who studies with strangers, right? My name is Jeff.
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: jeff
Jeff, it's a pleasure. My name is Pierce Hawthorne and, yes, That is Hawthorne as in Hawthorne wipes, The award-winning moist towellete.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: pierce
i was just going to ask.
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: group
i'm also a toast master, so perhaps I should do the introductions.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: pierce
definitely!
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: jeff
all right, you already know brittles.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: pierce
Britta.
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: jeff
Abed. Abed the arab. Is that inappropriate?
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: pierce
sure.
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: jeff
roy. roy the wonder boy.
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: pierce
"Troy".
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: jeff
little princess elizabeth.
	Speaker: annie	Listeners: pierce
"Annie".
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: jeff
and finally, this beautiful creature is named Shirley.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: shirley
is that even close?


	Speaker: annie	Listeners: group
i'd like to know why i had to find out About this group on accident?
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: group
this is getting way more like breakfast club now.
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: abed
there's breakfast?
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: group
okay, um, maybe we should get started--
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: group
you know, i've been a part of a lot of study groups that fell apart because of unresolved tension. Shouldn't we address Annie's concern?  Did we not invite her?
	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: jeff
well, Annie, sweetie, it's not behind your back. We just didn't think about,
	Speaker: annie	Listeners: shirley
can we stop with the "pumpkins" and the "sweeties"? Being younger does not make me inferior. If anything, your age indicates That you've made bad life decisions.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: shirley
Shirley has a response to that.
	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: jeff
no, no, no. i don't.
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: shirley
you should. it looks like you do.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: shirley
please, Shirley.
	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: annie
okay, okay. I'm sure i've made some bad life decisions And maybe Annie's decisions will be better. But i think she needs to decide Whether she wants to be considered a child Or an adult, because children get pity But not respect. And adults,  they get respect, But they also get the back of they head grabbed  And their face pushed through jukeboxes.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: group
okay. Why don't we try learning "jukebox" in spanish?
	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: pierce
what are you doing?
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: pierce
Pierce! Let's discuss this creepiness.
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: jeff
pardon you?
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: pierce
Are you unaware that Shirley Finds your advances inappropriate?
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: jeff
what advances?
	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: pierce
you have been sexually harassing me Since the very first day of class.
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: shirley
sexually harassing? what? That makes no sense to me. Why would i harass somebody who turns me on?
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: pierce
saying she turns you on is the harassment, dude.
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: troy
hey.
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: group
I am a prominent business leader And a highly sought after dinner guest And i will not take courting advice From some teenage boy.
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: pierce
well, this teenage boy  is a quarterback and a prom king.


	Speaker: britta	Listeners: jeff
what are you doing?
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: britta
i'm certified.


	Speaker: annie	Listeners: troy
you're not prom king anymore, Troy. This isn't riverside high.
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: annie
how'd you know i went there?
	Speaker: annie	Listeners: troy
because you're still wearing your stupid letter jacket. And more importantly, I sat behind you in Algebra.
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: jeff
Wait, you're that girl that got hooked on pills and then dropped out. You're little Annie "Adderall".
	Speaker: annie	Listeners: troy
Yes, and you are a stupid jock who lost his scholarship by dislocating both shoulders in a keg stand.
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: annie
Keg flip. They're very hard to pull off. You don't know-- I'm a legend.


	Speaker: abed	Listeners: group
You know what I got for Christmas? It was a banner year at the Bender family. I got a carton of cigarettes. The old man grabbed me, he said, "Hey, smoke up, Johnny!" "No, dad! What about you?"
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: abed
Well, uh, that-- That actually was from The Breakfast Club.
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: jeff
Nobody puts baby in the corner.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: group
Dirty Dancing.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: group
Uh, I'll be right back. But while I'm gone, you guys need to hash this stuff out. No stone unturned. Go!
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: group
What does that,
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: group
I can't feel my,
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: group
Okay, I am the Barack Obama of this room.


	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: duncan
Hello.
	Speaker: duncan	Listeners: jeff
It's Professor Duncan. Come to the parking lot now.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: duncan
What's wrong with your voice?
	Speaker: duncan	Listeners: jeff
I'm disguising it.


	Speaker: duncan	Listeners: jeff
Get in the car! Act as if either you have just finished or yet to begin driving. Every answer to every test in your curriculum this semester.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: duncan
I knew you could do it, buddy. Thank you.
	Speaker: duncan	Listeners: jeff
Whoa there, grabby-grabby. What do I get?
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: duncan
The satisfaction of being even.
	Speaker: duncan	Listeners: jeff
Even, fairness, right, wrong. There is no God. Booyah, booyah.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: duncan
What do you want from me?
	Speaker: duncan	Listeners: jeff
Your Lexus.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: duncan
My car for a semester's worth of answers?
	Speaker: duncan	Listeners: jeff
Will it be just a semester though, Jeff? Won't you be taking the easy way out for the next four years? I want payment in advance. I want leather seats with built-in ball warmers.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: duncan
You know, bluffs this weak are how your people lost the colonies.
	Speaker: duncan	Listeners: jeff
Have a nice disbarment hearing.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: duncan
What am I supposed to drive?
	Speaker: duncan	Listeners: jeff
Why don't you take this car? It's good for the earth.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: duncan
Yeah, so is wiping your butt with a leaf, but it's not how a man gets around! A golf kart!


	Speaker: britta	Listeners: jeff
It is a disaster in there.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: britta
Yeah, untutorable. You like Thai food? I love Thai food.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: jeff
Wait, so, this is a game to you? You put human beings into a state of emotional shambles for a shot at getting in my pants?
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: britta
Why can't you see that for the compliment that it is? Ok, ok. I'm sorry. It was an accident. I did a little bit of lying  to get close to you. But how was I suppose to know that you were smart and cool, I mean, you look like Elisabeth Shue.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: jeff
You're unbelievable.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: britta
What do you want me to do?
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: jeff
Oh, maybe one decent thing could be to go in there and clean up your mess.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: britta
Okay, if i do that, then dinner, right?
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: jeff
Yeah, fine, whatever. As if there's a dinner on Earth that could make me forget you are a shallow douchebag.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: britta
Oh, you're gonna eat those words when you see my new car.


	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: group
All right, everybody! I want to say something. Everybody, sit down.
	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: jeff
You don't have to yell.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: group
You know what makes humans different from other animals?
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: jeff
Feet.
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: troy
No, no, no, come on. Bears have feet.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: group
We're the only species on Earth that observes Shark Week. Sharks don't even observe Shark Week, but we do. For the same reason I can pick up this pencil, tell you it's name is Steve, and go like this. And part of you dies just a little bit on the inside, because people can connect with anything. We can sympathize with a pencil. We can forgive a shark. And we can give Ben Affleck an Academy Award for Screenwriting.
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: group
Big mistake.
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: pierce
He's got a point.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: group
People can find the good in just about anything but themselves. Look at me. It's clear to all of you that I am awesome, but I can never admit that, because that would make me an ass. But what I can do is see what makes Annie awesome. She's driven. We need driven people or the lights go out and the ice cream melts. And Pierce. We need guys like Pierce. This guy has wisdom to offer.
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: group
The Dalai Lama and I--
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: group
We should listen to him sometime. We wouldn't regret it. And Shirley. Shirley has earned our respect, Not as a wife, not as a mother, but as a woman. And don't test her on that, because that thing about the jukebox was way too specific to be improvised. And Troy. Who cares if Troy thinks he's all that? Maybe he is. You think astronauts go to the moon because they hate oxygen? No! They're trying to impress their high-school prom king. And Abed. Abed's a shaman. You ask him to pass the salt, he gives you a bowl of soup, because you know what? Soup is better. Abed is better. You are all better than you think you are. You are just designed not to believe it when you hear it from yourself.
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: abed
Soup?
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: group
I want you to look to the person to your left. Sorry. Look at the person sitting next to you.
	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: jeff
Look at her? Okay.
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: jeff
This?
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: abed
Yeah.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: group
I want you to extend to that person the same compassion that you extend to sharks, pencils, and Ben Affleck. I want you to say to that person, "I forgive you."
	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: annie
I forgive you.
	Speaker: annie	Listeners: shirley
I forgive you.
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: pierce
I forgive you.
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: troy
You little twerp.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: pierce
Pierce, I'd like you to say, "I forgive you."
	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: jeff
He didn't say it?
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: troy
I forgive you.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: group
You've just stopped being a study group. You have become something, unstoppable. I hereby pronounce you, a community.
	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: group
Oh, that's nice. I like that.
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: jeff
This isn't like Breakfast Club anymore. Now it's like Stripes or Meatballs. Anything with Bill Murray, really.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: group
I agree with Abed that tonight has been very special. And now, if you'll excuse me, I have a dinner engagement with Britta.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: group
Britta?
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: jeff
I lied. Thanks for calming everyone down. but since you're not a Spanish tutor, just a lying creep who purposely upset everyone in an attempt to get with me, I'd appreciate it if you left and stopped wasting all of our time.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: group
Everybody ready?
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: britta
Fine.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: group
And I'm happy to report that one of the benefits of being a lying creep is having all the answers to tomorrow's test. And I'm happy to share them with anyone whose time I've wasted more than they've wasted mine.
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: jeff
Uh, Jeff, if you have all the answers, why the hell did you start this study group?
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: pierce
I don't have a study group, Pierce. I made it up.
	Speaker: annie	Listeners: jeff
What about the "Look Left" speech?
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: annie
Made it up. That's what I do.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: group
I make things up, and I got paid a lot of money to do it before I came to this school-shaped toilet. I was a lawyer.
	Speaker: group	Listeners: self
Oh, God.
	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: group
That explains everything.
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: jeff
You know, I thought you were like Bill Murray in any of his films, but you're more like Michael Douglas in any of his films.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: abed
Yeah?
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: jeff
Yeah.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: abed
Well, you have Asperger's.
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: britta
What did he say?
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: self
"Ass-burger".
	Speaker: annie	Listeners: troy
It's a serious disorder.
	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: troy
It really is.
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: annie shirley
If it's so serious, why don't they call it meningitis?
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: self
"Ass-burger".
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: pierce
Burger for your ass.


	Speaker: duncan	Listeners: jeff
Jeffrey, before you say anything, you may want to think about the gift you've been given.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: pierce
An excuse to punch a hippy?
	Speaker: duncan	Listeners: jeff
No. No, not that. An important lesson, my friend. You see, the tools you acquired to survive out there will not help you here at Greendale. What you have, my friend, is a second chance at an honest life.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: duncan
Why are people trying  to teach me things At a school that has an express tuition aisle? Give me the keys.
	Speaker: duncan	Listeners: jeff
No, I have to keep your car for-- Don't hit me. Please, don't hit me. Jeffrey, Jeffrey! Are we cool? Are we cool? We're cool.


	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: jeff
I like you, Jeffrey. You remind me of myself at your age.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: pierce
I deserve that.
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: jeff
You know, I've been divorced seven times. Sometimes, I think I'm doing something wrong.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: pierce
You keep getting married.
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: jeff
I never looked at it that way.


	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: pierce troy
Shouldn't you guys be studying?
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: jeff
Yeah, things got kind of boring after you left. Let me ask you something. People becloud me for wearing this jacket ever since I got here, but  If I take it off to make them happy, That just makes me weak, right?
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: troy
Listen, it doesn't matter. You lose the jacket to please them, you keep it to piss them off, Either way It's for them. That's what's weak,
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: jeff
Wow. You just wrinkled my brain, man.
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: troy
He's good, isn't he?
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: pierce
He's really good.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: jeff
Shouldn't you be rolling around on a bed covered in test answers?
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: group
I don't have any of the answers. I'm gonna-- I'm gonna flunk the test.
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: jeff
You just, like, study for, like, an hour. It's not that hard. You seem pretty smart. You got a sports coat.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: group
I am me, Well, the funny thing about being smart is that you can get through most of life without ever having to do any work. So, uh, I'm not really sure how to do that.
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: group
What's going on? Can you guys hear me? Am I deaf? Can you hear me talking right now?
	Speaker: group	Listeners: abed
Yes.
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: group
That's good.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: jeff
You know what? Jeff, actually, we didn't get that far without you, so if you want to come back upstairs--
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: britta
Really?
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: jeff
Well, it is your study group, so.
	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: jeff
Come on, let's study.
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: group
Sounds good.
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: jeff
No pressure.


	Speaker: abed	Listeners: jeff
I'm sorry I called you Michael Douglas and I see your value now.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: abed
Well, that's the nicest thing anyone's ever said to me.


	Speaker: duncan	Listeners: extra
Absolutely not.
	Speaker: duncan	Listeners: extra
Waster! not a bathroom! Not a bathroom.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: extra
Shouldn't be too hard to fake a study group, right? Oh, geez, I'm sorry, I, I was raised on TV and I was conditioned to believe that every, Black woman over 50 is a cosmic mentor,
	Speaker: extra	Listeners: jeff
Were you conditioned to pay for your damn taco, Sanfield?
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: extra
Yes, I'm so sorry. It's Seinfeld.




Community - 1x02 - Spanish 101.HDTV.FXM.en.srt

	Speaker: dean	Listeners: self
Good afternoon, Greendale community college. I am your dean with a few corrections to the fall class catalog. Cosmology should be cosmetology, astrology should be astronomy, and the students on the cover should be smiling, but I suppose that's a matter of opinion. Whoever is growing a small patch of cannabis behind the gymnasium, congratulations. You have won a cruise. Report to security to claim your tickets. In order to increase awareness of homelessness, security has been given binoculars. In campus news, the debate over our library's PA system continues with some students suggesting its volume be lowered, while others question its very purpose. More on that story as it unfolds.


	Speaker: troy	Listeners: group
That dude makes a lot of announcements.
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: group
I like it, it makes every ten minutes feel like the beginning of a new scene of a tv show. Of course, the illusion only lasts until someone says something they'd never say on tv like, how much their life is like tv. There, it's gone.
	Speaker: annie	Listeners: group
I guess Jeff's running late again.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: group
Oh, What a shame. Maybe we should get started...
	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: group
I think we should wait for Jeff before we start studying.
	Speaker: annie	Listeners: britta
But maybe when Jeff gets here, we could talk to him as a group about his tardiness.
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: group
Don't use that word around Abed. In any case, if you want me to have a chat with Jeff, I'd be happy to do it. We've got a bond going, kind of. Sorta like brothers.
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: pierce
I hope your mom didn't make you take baths together 'cause one of you would've been like, 30.
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: troy
That's funny. You know, Jeff probably comes late so he doesn't have to sit through all of your tardiness.
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: abed
Sorry, Abed.
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: britta
Spoilers.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: annie
Real stories... They don't have spoilers. You understand that TV and life are different, right?
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: annie
My Lady.
	Speaker: annie	Listeners: jeff
My Lord.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: shirley
Hey, Baby.
	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: jeff
Hi, Sweetie.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: pierce
You smell nice. Vitamin P.
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: jeff
Morning, Jeffrey. People were jazzed to see me too.
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: jeff
Word 'em up.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: troy
Word 'em everywhere.
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: jeff
Good entrance.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: abed
That was for you.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: jeff
I think there's something that the  group would like to talk to you about.
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: jeff
Actually, there's nothing...
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: jeff
If you're gonna study with people, it would be cool of you to show up on time.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: group
Oh. Were you waiting? talking about your interesting personal lives and your cool emotional problems. I just feel like I never have anything to offer. Truth is my life is emptier than this three-ring binder.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: annie
Annie, Do you have any Spanish notes that might fit in there? Double-spaced. Thank you.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: group
So what's a guy got to do to get a "C" around here?
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: group
One-liner.
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: group
Good studying. See you later. Bye.


	Speaker: britta	Listeners: group
Will you guys have some self-respect? You're obsessing over someone who does not give you a second thought. Meanwhile, in Guatemala, journalists are being killed by their own government.
	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: britta
Baby, you, uh, jumped a column there. What's happening in Guatemala?
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: shirley
Nothing.
	Speaker: annie	Listeners: britta
Journalists are being murdered?
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: annie shirley
Believe me, every day in that country, people are being killed for speaking out. and the worst part of it is, when it's all over...
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: annie shirley
It's gonna be as if it never even happened.


	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: britta
You know what today is? The two-week anniversary of my horrible first impression.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: jeff
There's a card for that?
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: britta
Not specifically, but if you think of grandsons as a metaphor for friendship, I think you'll agree with this transformer here that it's time for ours to become a man. By reading from the Torah.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: jeff
Look, Jeff. You're harmless enough to me cause a life full of ups and downs has given me douche-ray vision, but those are good people in there, and they trust and respect you. Watching you exploit them, kinda bums me out.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: britta
Exploit them? They're my friends.
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: jeff
You want me to bring your car around, Jeff?
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: abed
No, Abed, I don't want you to bring my car around. I'll bring yours around, good guy. You get going, all right.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: jeff
You're cute, but selfish and narcissistic to the point of near delusion.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: britta
She said I was cute.


	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: jeff
Tell you what, you take her. I have less to prove. You can't pursue people so desperately. It starts to creep them out. Why don't we go get a beer? I'll give you some advice, and we can have what the  kids are calling a sausage fest.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: pierce
I'm not much of a sausage guy, Pierce. Maybe next time.
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: jeff
Next time, then.


	Speaker: annie	Listeners: britta
Will you tell us more about Guatemala?
	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: britta
I never went to a real college.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: annie shirley
You should discover that stuff on your own.
	Speaker: annie	Listeners: britta
But we need your help. We've been living on the wrong side of the looking glass. You're like Jodie Foster or Susan Sarandon. You'd rather keep it real than be likeable.
	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: britta
Can you at least tell us what to google?
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: annie shirley
You could start with this journalist Chacata-Panecos. He wrote an article critical of the government, and they killed him.
	Speaker: annie	Listeners: britta
That's horrible.
	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: britta
Can we have a protest? I want to protest the hell out of something.
	Speaker: annie	Listeners: shirley
We could have a candlelight vigil like lesbians have on the news.
	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: annie
I could make brownies.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: shirley
Brownies?


	Speaker: chang	Listeners: all
Every once in a while, a student come up to me and ask, Why do you teach Spanish?" They say it just like that. "Why do you teach Spanish?" "Why you?" Why not math? Why not photography? Why not martial arts? I mean, surely it must be in my nature to instruct you in something that's ancient and secret like building a wall that you can see from outer space. Well, I'll tell you  why I teach Spanish. It is none of your business, okay? Now, I don't want to have any conversations about what a mysterious and inscrutable man I am. I am a Spanish genius! In espanol, my nickname is "El tigre chino"! 'Cause my knowledge will bite her face off! So don't question Senor Chang or you'll get bit. Ya bit. Ya bit! Friday Manana, we'll be having conversations with the rest of the class using some of the phrases we learned in unit one. You'll be partnering up in pairs of dos. If you look under your desk, you'll find a card with either a picture or a word on it. For ejemplo, blondie aqui has a card with a picture of a house on it. So that means the person with the card with the word casa on it, is her partner. Comprende, Star-burns? See you Friday. Find your partners. Have a great day. And what do we say at the end of every class? Come on, hands... 90 percent of Spanish.


	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: abed
You want to trade cards? I'll give you 20 bucks.
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: jeff
No.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: abed
50 bucks.
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: jeff
I don't want your money. I want your shirt.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: abed
What?
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: jeff
I've had my eye on it since registration day.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: abed
All right, fine. Give me your card.
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: jeff
I don't think you understand. I want to wear it out of here.


	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: britta
What are the odds?
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: jeff
Are you sure you didn't adjust the odds? I know Abed's been eyeing that shirt for three weeks. It's almost like you gave it to him so he would switch cards.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: britta
I gave Abed my shirt because I'm not selfish, which is something I guess you'll finally  discover while we are working on this. Tomorrow night? Dinner, drinks.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: jeff
I think that's something we should discuss with our partners. Oh, see, I did switch cards.
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: jeff
Can you believe this? What are the odds?
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: jeff
That's a nice shirt. Want to sell it?
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: pierce
Yes.


	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: jeff
What's the moist towelette industry like? Believe me, it's nothing like the product. Nah. It's a hard, dry, large business. Destroyed all my marriages. Of course it didn't help any that  I can't have children. I'm not sterile. In fact, it's a rare condition they call "hyper-virility". Apparently my sperm shoot through the egg like bullets. Can you believe that?
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: pierce
I can't. But you can, so that's fine. So, the assignment is to,uh, write a Spanish conversation using those five phrases.
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: jeff
Hemingway's Lemonade.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: pierce
We don't need to make this a long evening. We can just..
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: jeff
Am I a piece of garbage to you?
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: pierce
What? No!
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: jeff
Got ya. Let's have one drink before we work. To the "empowerage" of words.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: pierce
To the irony of that sentence.
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: jeff
So what's up with you, Jeffrey? It seems like you got a burr up your ass or something.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: pierce
Well, I guess that it's... I think it's Britta.
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: jeff
Forget Britta. ...you have to know is her name. What is she, a water filter? She's ugly.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: pierce
Why don't we start with me saying...
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: jeff
What are you doing?
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: pierce
Our assignment.
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: jeff
Oh no no no. This is the first time people are gonna see Winger and Hawthorne together. We are gonna show them we're a force to be reckoned with. Come on, let's brainstorm some story ideas. Better yet, before we do that, let's ask ourselves... What is a story?
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: pierce
Oh, My God in heaven.


	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: extra
If you like that brownie, you'll gonna hate what's going up on in Guatemala. Google it.
	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: britta
Raise the truth.
	Speaker: annie	Listeners: britta
Once it gets dark, I hand out the candles and we do  what's called "a speechless protest". We put the tape over our mouths, and gather hand-in-hand in a sea of outraged silence.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: starburns
Starburns, no.
	Speaker: annie	Listeners: britta
What's gotten into you?
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: annie shirley
This is not how you do this.
	Speaker: annie	Listeners: britta
We know it's not how you do it cause we're doing everything.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: annie shirley
But this is tacky and lame. I didn't mean that. I'm sorry. What I meant to say is that this cause is really personal to me.
	Speaker: annie	Listeners: britta
Are you saying that we're not allowed to protest? Britta, you sound like Guatemala.
	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: britta
Sounds like somebody has the case of "likes to use French politics to make themselves special, "but doesn't actually ever want to do anything-itis."
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: shirley annie
No. I do things. I went to... I don't do anything. What can I do?
	Speaker: annie	Listeners: britta
You can hang the Chacata-Panecos pinata.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: shirley annie
You guys realize he was beaten to death, right?
	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: britta
That's where we got the idea from.
	Speaker: annie	Listeners: shirley
Poignant.


	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: jeff
Alright, tell me what I've got so far.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: pierce
What we have so far? We have something incredibly long, and very confusing, and a little homophobic. And really, really, specifically, surprisingly, and gratuitously critical of Israel. And it's called "two conquistadors", should probably be "dos". I mean, it is a Spanish class. Oh, which reminds me, the only thing not included in this epic are the five phrases required to get me a passing grade.
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: jeff
You're right. Needs more work.
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: jeff
Okay What do we do about the ending of act two?


	Speaker: abed	Listeners: jeff pierce
What are you guys doing?
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: abed
I have no idea.
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: jeff pierce
Well, we're headed to the demonstration.
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: abed
What, Hippies?
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: pierce jeff
Some cause Britta's into.
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: pierce jeff
It's a silent protest. Lots of candles. Gets the ladies in the mood for social  change. If you know what I mean. Good chance to put some miles on this shirt.
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: troy abed
You realize these conversations are due in the morning. Don't you?
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: abed
Right. What do you want to do?

Hacks.


	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: pierce
I'll tell you what we're gonna do. We're gonna take this, and we're gonna  put it in a museum for crazy people. And then we're gonna take this, and memorize five phrases from it tomorrow morning before class. Good night.
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: jeff
Wait a minute, Wait a minute, Wait a minute. You're bailing on our first sausage fest? This is your definition of friendship?
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: pierce
No. This is my definition of you trying way too hard, and me finding it harder  and harder to stay polite. Now this was a fine enough way to spend an evening, devoid of hope, but a woman I kind of like is out there in the moonlight caring about something stupid, and this is my chance to show her that  I care enough to act like I care about it too.
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: jeff
That's all you had to say, Jeff.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: pierce
That was it? That would've been great if I had done that two hours ago!


	Speaker: britta	Listeners: jeff
Nice sign.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: britta
Thanks. I like what you've done with the place.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: jeff
I think I was a little too harsh on you. I'm not perfect.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: britta
I am. I'd be happy to show you the ropes.
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: jeff
Awesome! Look at awesome Jeffrey Winger. Too awesome for old Pierce with your hip shirts, and your gelled hair, and your cool tape over your mouth.
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: all
Why is everybody wearing tape over their mouth?
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: pierce
It's a protest, Pierce.
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: jeff
Oh, good. Cause I know what I'd like to protest... How much you hurt me.
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: jeff
First, you constantly blow me off, then you want me to do your homework, then you tell me I'm trying too hard to be your friend so you have to go. You have to come out here to pretend to care about the stupid stuff she cares about.
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: britta
His words, not mine.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: britta
He is paraphrasing.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: pierce
Pierce, I got an idea. Why don't you go get a cup of coffee, and hold some waitress hostage with a monologue about your sperm.
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: jeff
I'll show you some sperm, buddy. Was this your idea? What the hell? Fire.
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: all
I'm not ready to die.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: britta
He's jumped in the fountain. He's fine.


	Speaker: abed	Listeners: troy
Conflicts like these will ultimately bring us together as an unlikely family.
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: abed
You have horrible breath right now.
	Speaker: annie	Listeners: britta
Have you seen it?
	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: britta
We did it, girl... Page three. Its uh, mostly about Pierce, but listen to that last paragraph.
	Speaker: annie	Listeners: britta
"The incident occurred during a protest regarding events in Guatemala." Awareness!
	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: britta
And this isn't the school paper, by the way. This is a real damn paper, there's a marmaduke in there.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: shirley annie
Well, it's more than  I ever accomplished.
	Speaker: annie	Listeners: shirley
Did you guys know about  the ethnic cleansing in Burma?
	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: annie
Need to bust out that brownie mix.


	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: britta
Morning.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: jeff
Morning.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: jeff
Oh. no, I get it. Garfield's wishing me a happy Arbor Day, And you'd like a fresh start.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: britta
Nice try. It's actually secretary's day, and it says that I'm sorry about crashing your protest with that drunken, self-immolating baby boomer.
	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: jeff
We don't blame you, sweetie. Pierce has always been on my watch list.
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: jeff
That dude is crazy... He told me girls have two pee holes.
	Speaker: annie	Listeners: jeff
I sang Christmas carols at a nursing home once. I've seen the face of dementia, and last night I saw it again.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: group
You know what he did that's really crazy? He offered me $100 to switch cards with him just so he could be partners with Jeff. I think he thought getting closer to Jeff would bring him respect in the group. I think he spent his whole life looking out for himself and he would trade it all for a shot at some kind of family.


	Speaker: chang	Listeners: all
Hola, class. Time for our presentations. First up was supposed to be Jeff and Pierce, but Pierce explained the situation. Apparently there was a falling out, things were said, people were betrayed.
	Speaker: chang	Listeners: jeff
Jeff, having heard Pierce's side of the story, I think the only humane thing to do would be to give you a "C" and let Pierce do his presentation alone, if that sounds fair to you.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: chang
That doesn't sound fair to me at all.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: pierce
Pierce, I understand that if you don't want to be my friend, but this thing we've created... It is bigger than the both of us, and it deserves to be done right.
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: jeff
All right.
	Speaker: chang	Listeners: jeff
Okay, guys? Why are there costumes involved? These are short conversations, they're not supposed to take...
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: chang
Your breath away? Well, tough.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: pierce
You ready, amigo?
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: jeff
Si.
	Speaker: chang	Listeners: jeff
F.
	Speaker: chang	Listeners: pierce
F-minus.
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: chang
What? Did you say S?


	Speaker: britta	Listeners: jeff
So. That was one of the worst things I have ever seen, which I guess makes being a part  of it, a pretty selfless act, so I'm impressed.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: britta
Well, how do you know I didn't do it just to get another shot at you?
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: jeff
Cause a smart guy like you would know that no woman in that class would be able  to look at you as a sexually viable candidate ever again.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: britta
No, I know. I thought of that.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: self
She looked back.


	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: jeff
You did an all right job  up there, my friend.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: pierce
Thanks Pierce

	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: group
you guys, i found it. the ultimate blow-off class. Professor Whitman. he thinks he's in dead poets society. There's no tests. there's no work. It's just "day seizing." The deadline to enroll is tomorrow. I suggest you all do it.
	Speaker: annie	Listeners: jeff

	Speaker: troy	Listeners: jeff

	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: annie jeff
i'll do it. i love robin williams.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: abed
abed?
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: jeff
not a fan. In every movie, there's an authority figure That gets mad at him for making people laugh.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: abed
no, are--are you going to take the class?
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: jeff
oh, can't.
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: group
My dad will only pay for classes That will help me run the family restaurant. It's been struggling since 2001. 9/11 was pretty much the 9/11 of the falafel business.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: abed
so your dad has your whole life planned out for you? Are you even interested in falafel?
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: britta
i'm interested in making movies. But my dad says all media's western propaganda That negatively stereotypes arabs.
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: group
then he should see aladdin. jafar was a bad-ass.
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: troy
yes, he was.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: abed
abed.
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: britta
mm.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: abed

	Speaker: abed	Listeners: britta

	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: britta
Britta.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: jeff
Jeff.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: britta
Britta.
	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: britta
isn't abed's dad a hardcore muslim?  They're not as understanding as christians. You can get your head cut off with a salami sword.
	Speaker: annie	Listeners: shirley
Shirley! That's the most racist thing i've ever heard.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: annie
Pierce will beat that in one minute.
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: britta

	Speaker: abed	Listeners: group
the memo says "for dreams."
	Speaker: group	Listeners: abed

	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: group

	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: troy
hey, Troy sneezes like a girl.
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: jeff
and how about i pound you like a boy? That didn't come out right.
	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: group
why don't you all just leave him alone With his cute little baby sneezes.
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: shirley
you're not my mother.
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: troy
she's not?
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: group
29 seconds.


	Speaker: whitman	Listeners: shirley
what's your name?
	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: whitman
my name is Shirley Bennett.
	Speaker: whitman	Listeners: shirley
Shirley, you get an "a"...
	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: whitman
oh.
	Speaker: whitman	Listeners: shirley
if you can tell me why you are here at greendale.
	Speaker: whitman	Listeners: shirley
Shirley?
	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: whitman
to get a degree in business So i can sell my baked goods and whatnot on the internet.
	Speaker: whitman	Listeners: shirley
why...are you here?
	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: whitman
to get a degree in business So i can sell my baked goods and whatnot on the internet.
	Speaker: whitman	Listeners: shirley
why are you here?
	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: whitman
because i wasted 15 years of my life on a man Who left me with nothing but stretch marks And a foggy memory of two bland orgasms. And now it's time to get what's mine.
	Speaker: whitman	Listeners: all
day seized. Only when we stop stopping our lives Can we begin to start starting them. Ms. Edison here, for example, would rather write About what happens to other people Than live what is happening to her.


	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: troy
what'd i tell you? Okay, but, uh, never again.


	Speaker: annie	Listeners: whitman
i thought there might be a quiz.
	Speaker: whitman	Listeners: annie
well, here's a quiz for you. Why did the pretty young girl die alone Surrounded by sweater-wearing cats Who are trained to use human toilets?
	Speaker: whitman	Listeners: all
Get up on your desk. Come on. stand on your desk. Up on your desk. She made it! ha ha! Everyone stand on your desks! Up, up, up, up, up! come on. Rise, rise, rise above the programming. All your lives you were told don't stand on your desks. Well, why not?
	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: extra
ooh! ooh! oh, heaven. My.
	Speaker: whitman	Listeners: all
she's okay. Go to the nurse. seize the day.
	Speaker: whitman	Listeners: all
your homework. ah. I want you to swim in a lake And tell ten people that you love them.
	Speaker: whitman	Listeners: jeff
Mr. winger, can i have a word, please?
	Speaker: annie	Listeners: extra
are you okay.
	Speaker: extra	Listeners: annie
oh, maybe i'm not.


	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: shirley
you know, i was really moved by your honesty earlier. Particularly the part about your husband Not being able, you know...


	Speaker: whitman	Listeners: jeff
hi. Mr. winger, i like to think that every life That passes through this class is changed. But every year, there's always one cocky opportunist Who's just here to coast and grab an easy "a."
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: whitman
oh, yeah. his name's Pierce. I-i can talk to him for you.
	Speaker: whitman	Listeners: jeff
It's actually you, mr. winger. You have no intention of seizing the day.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: whitman
what? listen, i-i have never lived Until i met you. I-i love you. Oh, there's one down. nine to go. Not that i need the grade or even want it!
	Speaker: whitman	Listeners: jeff
well, i'm glad to hear it. Because if you don't genuinely seize the day Before the end of the week, Then you will be seizing an "f" for the semester.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: whitman
you... This is no way to teach accounting!


	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: britta
i have to plan in advance How to prove that i live in the moment. I mean, i'd rather take an actual class, But now it's too late to drop or add.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: jeff
it is not fair how hard it is for you to cheat here.


	Speaker: britta	Listeners: abed
hey, how's it going? How's your film class, buddy?
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: britta
it's cool. our first assignment is a documentary. They're like real movies, but with ugly people. I'm learning a lot.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: abed jeff
that is so wonderful. Some people don't like getting involved In other's lives. I think it's great.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: abed britta
hey, if you're making a documentary About Britta patting herself on the back, You're gonna need a backup battery.
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: jeff
actually, i'm doing a movie about my dad.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: jeff
that is brilliant. How did he react to you signing up for the film class? that part hasn't happened yet. here he comes.
	Speaker: abeddad	Listeners: self
hey! you want to get involved in my family's business?
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: self
holy...war.
	Speaker: abeddad	Listeners: jeff
where do i find mr. Britta?
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: abeddad
i'm mr. Britta. That's right. i'm a woman with rights. And you can see my whole face.
	Speaker: abeddad	Listeners: britta
oh, i get it! Because i'm arab, i must hate women. Let me tell you something, i love women. But i'm getting a major b-word vibe from you.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: abeddad
wow, i can't believe i missed out On getting involved in this.
	Speaker: abeddad	Listeners: britta
you go host american idol And you stop messing with my son. He's a special boy. I raise him, okay? you don't raise him.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: abeddad
raising him means letting him follow his dreams.
	Speaker: abeddad	Listeners: britta
dreams are for sleeping.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: abeddad
you don't know that.
	Speaker: abeddad	Listeners: britta
it's clinically proven.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: abeddad
so's polio.
	Speaker: abeddad	Listeners: britta
you lost me!
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: abeddad
abed wants to study film.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: abed
wait, what is he saying?
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: britta
he says "we're leaving."
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: abed
tell him that you want to stay and study film.
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: britta
i don't think i'm really in the scene.
	Speaker: abeddad	Listeners: britta jeff abed
see, it was hard enough to talk to him before. Now we have this between us!
	Speaker: abeddad	Listeners: abed
Let's go!
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: abeddad
hey! hey!
	Speaker: abeddad	Listeners: britta
hey, don't touch me!
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: britta abeddad
guys, guys, stop it. stop it.
	Speaker: abeddad	Listeners: britta
you don't touch me!
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: britta
Britta back up. stop.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: abeddad
Sir, you have a right to your faith And your family's privacy. But abed is an adult and a u.s. citizen.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: abed
Right?
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: jeff
yeah.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: abeddad
and he has the right to stay.
	Speaker: abeddad	Listeners: jeff
fine. you want to raise him, you raise him. I'm out!
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: abeddad
wait, what?
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: abeddad
you know, i had a father like you. And the day i finally cut myself loose is the day i finally started being happy.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: abed
well, that went well.
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: jeff
i'll have to make some adjustments to my film. Jeff, i think you should play the role of my father.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: abed
i don't want to be your father.
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: jeff
that's perfect. you already know your lines.


	Speaker: britta	Listeners: jeff
What? Why are you dressed like an '80s rapist?
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: britta
professor Whitman comes by here every morning And i need him to see me celebrating life. What's all that?
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: jeff
i am calculating abed's expenses For the semester. You know, there's books. there's meals. He's renting that camera. And, you know, he needs a little spending money.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: britta
um, all money is spending money.
	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: britta
Britta, um, it's amazing what you're doing for abed. I mean, a lot of people talk a good game. But you, you follow through. love you.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: shirley
Shirley, thank you. Bet that doesn't happen to you a lot.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: britta
happened yesterday. Shirley's just doing her homework.
	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: extra
hillary, thank you for getting people coffee. I love you.


	Speaker: britta	Listeners: abed
abed, how's it going, buddy?
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: britta
good. my film is coming together.
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: jeff
Cool tie, Jeff. Are you wearing that Because you're playing the role of my dad, Or is it really christmas?
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: abed
definitely christmas.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: abed
is that a new camera?
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: britta
yeah.
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: britta
It's more expensive, But it lets me adjust really specific settings That most people don't notice or think about.
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: extra
Hi, i would like a latte.
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: jeff
And, Jeff, let me get you something.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: abed
i'm okay.
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: jeff
oh, come on. i got you.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: abed
no, really. i don't need anything.
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: jeff
no, really. you're insulting me. Look at all this cash.


	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: abed
okay, i will get a small, black coffee.
	Speaker: whitman	Listeners: jeff
boo. an ordinary coffee for an ordinary life.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: whitman
good morning, professor Whitman.
	Speaker: whitman	Listeners: jeff
sorry, mr. winger, these won't cut it.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: self
shazbot!
	Speaker: whitman	Listeners: extra
i shall have... A birthday cake!


	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: troy
i've seen men in your situation, Troy. No, those are both for me. You were on top of the world before And now no one gives a rat's ass. I can help you with your image. First, lose the jacket. You look like a high school bitch. But more importantly, it's your sneeze. When i was a ceo, I had an array of masculine sneezes That asserted dominance. You know, like, the explosive, Shock-the-room-into-silence sneeze. Or the draw-them-in sneeze. You know... And maybe i wouldn't sneeze because i'm in control. You could even use a sneeze to drive home a point even. Like, i think-- i think the cubs Are going to win it all this year. What do you think?
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: pierce
tell me more.


	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: self
it's showtime.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: all
Hey, everybody. good morning. Good morning, sir. Good morning, greendale! hi! good morning! Watch the kite. uh-oh. Mind if i get a chance? oh! Look at this. one foot. Thanks, you guys. bring it in here. Nice. thank you so much, you guys. That was really fun.
	Speaker: whitman	Listeners: jeff
sloppy. And considering the age of these girls, Unwittingly creepy.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: whitman
damn it.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: extra
Beat it.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: whitman
Professor, will you look at the amount of work That i'm putting into this? I mean, throw me a bone!
	Speaker: whitman	Listeners: jeff
had i not already cried at the sunrise this morning, I would be weeping right now.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: whitman
what does that mean?
	Speaker: whitman	Listeners: jeff
what do you mean, Jeff? What does your life mean? How long does it take you in the morning To--to make it look like you have bed head? How many sweat pants, sport jacket combos did you try Before you found the one that said "i don't care"? Seize the day, Jeff, for real. Go running naked in a hailstorm, Kiss a girl in the middle of the day, Fly a kite, but do it for yourself. Or you won't just fail my class, You'll fail life.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: whitman
thank you.


	Speaker: britta	Listeners: jeff
That guy's really got your number.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: britta
drop the flower.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: jeff
look, i really need to talk to you about abed. I went by his film class today. he wasn't there. He's cutting. I want to know why he would do something like that.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: britta
ask him.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: jeff
every time i try to ask him about it, He just keeps filming me and telling me That i'm playing the role of his mother.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: britta
abed is not normal. That's what you bought When you intentionally tangled yourself in his life.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: jeff
look, will you just-- will you please talk to him?
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: britta
i've got problems of my own! I'm out here trying to seize a day!
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: britta
What in the hell? Is he gonna kill us?


	Speaker: troy	Listeners: abed
thanks for the pizza, abed. i was starving.
	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: abed
yeah, it's nice. like a--like a picnic.
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: abed
or a family dinner.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: group
it's a study group and a pizza. Let's not get carried away.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: abed
so, abed, how's film class?
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: jeff
good.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: abed
yeah? did you go to class today?
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: jeff
not really.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: abed
not really. Well, Britta's paying for those classes. Don't you think maybe you should go?
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: jeff
i was shooting my movie.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: abed
yeah, but your movie's for class.
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: britta
my movie's more important.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: abed
well, ooh la la.
	Speaker: extra	Listeners: group
someone order seven lattes?
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: extra
i got that.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: extra
no, you don't got it. I got it, abed. i got everything. What is wrong with you? All i want to do is take care of you. I know you're not stupid. are you doing this on purpose? Why won't you answer me?
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: britta
'cause this is the scene where you leave.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: abed
you better believe it.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: abed
Britta.
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: jeff
what do you think, dad?
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: abed
i think you are really weird, abed. And i think the wrong person just left.
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: group
perfect. that's a wrap.
	Speaker: extra	Listeners: abed
that guy was your dad?


	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: britta
hey.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: jeff
hey. You don't really have tickets for ravi shankar, do you?
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: britta
i lied to get you here Because it's time to communicate.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: jeff
communicate. have you met abed?
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: britta
it's not the two of you that need to talk.
	Speaker: abeddad	Listeners: jeff
hey, wait a minute, where's weezer?
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: abeddad
they're coming.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: abeddad britta
All right, now, the only reason Why this whole mess got started Is because both of you wanted the best for abed. And i think the lesson we can all take away from this Is that everyone should always do Whatever they want and leave each other out of it.
	Speaker: abeddad	Listeners: jeff britta
is that your take? let me give you mine. You and your pillow-lipped girlfriend Got all up in my stuff because you wanted to be cowboys And then you turned chicken when you found out It will take more than speeches and guided missiles.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: abeddad
interesting. hadn't seen the iraq metaphor, but--
	Speaker: abeddad	Listeners: jeff
what iraq metaphor? I am talking about your speeches And her guided--
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: abeddad
got it!
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: britta
The point is is that Britta is sorry, right?
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: jeff
wrong.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: self
crap.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: abeddad
abed may not be a great filmmaker, But that doesn't mean that he wants to make falafel. You need to let him make his own decisions.
	Speaker: abeddad	Listeners: britta
make his own decisions? Have you met abed? you know who he is?
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: britta abeddad
guys.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: abeddad
yes.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: britta abeddad
guys!
	Speaker: abeddad	Listeners: britta
he loves--


	Speaker: abed	Listeners: jeff britta abeddad
i'm finished.
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: jeff britta abeddad
Britta, Jeff, dad.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: abed
how's it going, buddy?
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: abed
i don't want to be your father. I think you are weird, abed.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: jeff
okay, look, i need to talk to you about abed.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: britta
he's not normal.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: abed
what is wrong with you? All i want to do is take care of you. Why will you not answer me?
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: jeff
what do you think, dad?
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: abed
i think you are weird, abed. And i think the wrong person just left.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: britta
it's not exactly citizen kane.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: jeff
i feel a little out of the loop here.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: britta
that feeling is called the joy of freedom.
	Speaker: abeddad	Listeners: jeff britta
my son is hard to understand. If making movies help him be understood, Then i pay for the class.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: jeff
i made this all happen.
	Speaker: abeddad	Listeners: jeff britta
with falafel as a fallback.


	Speaker: britta	Listeners: abed
abed.
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: britta
yeah.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: abed
did you do all of that to me on purpose? That's not a very nice way to treat your friends.
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: britta
well, Britta, it isn't called friend business, It's called show business.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: jeff
he's smoking.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: britta
honey, let him leave the nest.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: jeff
get your hand off my knee.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: britta
sorry.


	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: troy
god--god bless you. god bless you.
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: shirley
thank you.


	Speaker: britta	Listeners: jeff
for someone who doesn't like getting involved, Well, i owe you.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: britta
you owe me. That cannot be comfortable for you.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: jeff
hey, um, you should kiss me right now.
	Speaker: whitman	Listeners: jeff
day seized!
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: jeff
we're even.
	Speaker: whitman	Listeners: jeff
"a" plus, winger. I know a life-changing kiss when i see one. Wowee! ha ha!
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: britta
yeah. fooled you.


	Speaker: abed	Listeners: troy
am I krumping?
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: abed
no.
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: troy
am I krumping?
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: abed
no.
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: troy
am I krumping now?
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: abed
no.
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: troy
am I krumping now?
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: troy
No! This is krumping.
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: jeff
We are krumping.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: troy
No you are not


	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: extra
hey, man. my name's Jeff. I'm trying to lock down the rest of my schedule Before the deadline. I heard this class was a cakewalk. Are you passing it? Do you like dane cook?
	Speaker: extra	Listeners: jeff
yeah, he's awesome.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: extra
so far so good.

	Speaker: chang	Listeners: all
Before we wrap up, i would like to thank you guys For filling out these anonymous evaluation cards. I found your feedback To be largely constructive and flattering, So gracias on that.
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: chang
De nada.
	Speaker: chang	Listeners: abed
You don't have to sign your name anymore.
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: chang
Got it.
	Speaker: chang	Listeners: annie
But there was one evaluation That was so harsh and hurtful And racist That i took the time personally To analyze that handwriting against past exams. And this particular coward Dots her is with tiny, Itty-Bitty, little circles. Boop. Boop. Tcch! Isn't that precious and cute? Who's "erratic and unstable" now, Princess Gringa?


	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: jeff
Nice day out today, isn't it?
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: shirley
Yeah. Shoot!


	Speaker: britta	Listeners: jeff
You forget something?
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: britta
Yeah. I forgot to stagger the timing of my exit with shirley's. We both have a class across campus, and i can't go That kind of distance with "ooh, that's nice."
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: jeff
That's mean.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: britta
No. that's not nice.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: jeff
I find shirley very easy to talk to, And besides, aren't you supposed to have, Like, an olympic gold medal in jibber-Jabber?
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: britta
Yeah, but i'm a sprinter. I am at my best during high-Speed bursts of wit. On a shirley walk, i'd be winded by that stoner tree.


	Speaker: vaughn	Listeners: britta
Hey, britta, hi. What's up?
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: vaughn
Hey, vaughn, how's it going?
	Speaker: vaughn	Listeners: britta
No worries.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: britta
Interesting. 'Cause i might be worried If i was playing hacky sack a decade too late.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: jeff
My class is that way.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: britta
All right, but i just wanted to point out That we easily walked more than 100 yards With no awkward pauses, And that is the sign of a true friend.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: jeff
I am really glad that you're not hitting on me anymore.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: britta
There's the awkward pause.


	Speaker: annie	Listeners: extra
Excuse me. Oh, sorry, ladies.
	Speaker: annie	Listeners: duncan
Professor duncan! Professor duncan!
	Speaker: duncan	Listeners: annie
What?
	Speaker: annie	Listeners: duncan
Excuse me. Annie edison. I am in your 101 lecture.
	Speaker: duncan	Listeners: annie
Hello.
	Speaker: annie	Listeners: duncan
I've heard about your special psych lab.
	Speaker: duncan	Listeners: annie
Ah. The duncan principle.
	Speaker: annie	Listeners: duncan
Yes. And i know it's limited to second-Year students, But i had a 4.0 at riverside high, And i'm not looking down on this school at all, But i'm only here because of a brief addiction to pills That i was told would help me...focus, But they actually made me lose my scholarship and virginity. So--
	Speaker: duncan	Listeners: annie
Right.
	Speaker: annie	Listeners: duncan
If you would let me take your lab early, It would be a real feather in my transcript.

	Speaker: duncan	Listeners: all
Welcome, research assistants. If you turn your attention to the monitor, You will see that our subjects Are waiting for the experiment to begin, but... It's actually happening right now.
	Speaker: all	Listeners: duncan
Wow.
	Speaker: duncan	Listeners: all
You see, the waiting is the experiment. The duncan principle is simple. Namely, that the more control lost by the-- Yeah, i'm gonna write this down too, actually. That's a good point. The more control lost by the ego, The more gained by the id, Resulting in a surprisingly predictable Emotional eruption or breaking point, Known to ma and pa as a good old-Fashioned tantrum. Oh.
	Speaker: duncan	Listeners: annie
Annie, why don't you, uh, go and tell our subjects That we're going to be starting the experiment In five minutes, okay? And annie... It's never actually going to start.
	Speaker: garrett	Listeners: all
Ho ho.
	Speaker: duncan	Listeners: all

	Speaker: chang	Listeners: annie
No, no, no! No, no, no, no, no! It's unacceptable, all right? You lied to me! When you say something starts at 9:00, It starts at nueve!
	Speaker: chang	Listeners: all
No! No!
	Speaker: duncan	Listeners: all
Houston, we have an idiot.


	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: jeff

	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: shirley

	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: jeff
Mm-Hmm. Don't go too fast for these dogs. Short legs. So how do you like--
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: shirley

	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: jeff

There's a generic whack job, bouncing up and down Like a six-Foot child. Shaking. Write that down. Visible shakes. Look at the little one chase the big one. Look at him go. I am gonna make him go quicker. It's like benny hill looks. Whoo, ooh, ooh, get him. Come back again. Whoo, ooh, ooh, get him. All right? There's a bit of fun. It lightens the mood. And back to the present. And then there were two. Break.

	Speaker: duncan	Listeners: all
Do you know what? The longer they wait, the harder they break. Buckle up, students.


	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: jeff

	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: shirley
I am so glad to be able to talk to someone about this. I wanted to say something to britta about it, But we're supposed to be friends now, And she'd think i was jealous.
	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: jeff
I don't see why you and britta aren't together. Two cute white people, going to school together, Just seems right.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: shirley
Shirley, we're not pandas in a zoo.
	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: jeff
Oh. Oh, dear.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: shirley

	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: britta
Uh, first of all, Friends do not make fun of each other, Even if they're being tackled in the quad by a hippie, And secondly, vaughn seems cool.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: jeff
Well, you guys should hang out sometime. I gotta go. I--Uh, that was tacky out there. You won't ever see that again.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: britta
Oh, no worries, brah.

Shirley, did you see senor chang's socks today? Tiny bullfighters.
	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: jeff
I can top that. Did you see that hacky sack wears an anklet? Since when won't you talk about vaughn?
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: shirley
Look, i'm trying to be a good friend to britta. She thought i was gonna make fun of him, But i want to be unpredictable. I am gonna show her that i am not the jerk she thinks i am And friend the hell out of That green-Tea-Drinking drum circler.

	Speaker: britta	Listeners: jeff
What do you want to be?
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: britta
Is there a spot on the friendship spectrum Between total stranger And having to hear about the guys you date? And ideally, just a notch underneath Driving you to the airport and painting your kitchen?
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: jeff
How about the friend level Where you sometimes have to cat-Sit?
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: britta
Done. And if i'm occasionally naked in your dreams, I won't complain.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: shirley
Shirley.

	Speaker: deanbot	Listeners: self
greendale, greendale, Greendale!


	Speaker: duncan	Listeners: jeff
ah! Jeff, Jeff. Good morning! How is student life, my dry-witted friend?
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: duncan
probably the same as teacher life, But less tragic, because i get to leave.
	Speaker: duncan	Listeners: jeff
very dry. very witty. Not a great friend. Listen, i wanted to ask you about that young lady In your spanish class. You know, the blonde with the pouty, strident Cate blanchett sexuality and the ridiculous name?
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: duncan
Britta?
	Speaker: duncan	Listeners: jeff
that's it, that's it. Imagine living with that. can you imagine? Unbelievable. Anyway, are you two an item, and if so, Would that item be impervious to sabotage?
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: duncan
you know, you have the savoir faire of a hyena. How is it that you and james bond Come from the same island?
	Speaker: duncan	Listeners: jeff
message received. I'll just wait for you to finish striking out first. cheers.
	Speaker: duncan	Listeners: jeff
Have a nice day.


	Speaker: abed	Listeners: duncan
m.a.s.h.
	Speaker: duncan	Listeners: abed
fawlty towers. game over.


	Speaker: abed	Listeners: troy
do you think luis guzman Will ever come to visit his statue? If so, i'd like to ask him about his movie choices, particularly carlito's way, the cowboy way, the hard way, and q&a.
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: abed
yeah, luis guzman is on a private jet from hollywood, Because he can't wait to have that conversation with you.
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: troy
really? how does he know about me?
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: abed
because he called me on my cell phone.
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: troy
why would a movie actor call you?
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: abed
you don't know?
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: troy
no.
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: abed
i'm president obama's nephew.
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: troy
you never mentioned that.
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: abed
i didn't know if i could trust you. But now it's time to tell you everything-- Starting with me inventing the ferrari.


	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: britta
so...i guess the cell phone number You put on the study group's contact sheet was fake, Which i just learned in the awkward conclusion Of a month-long text message affair with a dude from boulder.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: jeff
sorry.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: britta
that's okay. Just give me your real number. I'll cleanse my palate while kevin rethinks his marriage.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: jeff
I'll give you my number if you promise not to use it In any other context than friendship.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: britta
uh...pass.


	Speaker: chang	Listeners: all
silencio, por favor.
	Speaker: chang	Listeners: starburns
Star burns-- that means you.
	Speaker: starburns	Listeners: chang
my name's alex, dude.
	Speaker: chang	Listeners: starburns
well, maybe you should spend five hours Sculpting that in your face.
	Speaker: chang	Listeners: all
All right, last night i graded your tests. I'm sure you wanna know how you did, right?
	Speaker: all	Listeners: chang
yes, i would.
	Speaker: chang	Listeners: all
well, i'm not gonna tell you. Until i find out who did...this!
	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: chang
what is that?
	Speaker: chang	Listeners: shirley
it's a tiny piece of paper, okay? That's all it is. tiny piece of paper.
	Speaker: chang	Listeners: all
Containing all the information covered on the test. Otherwise known as a crib sheet. Who did it, huh?
	Speaker: chang	Listeners: annie
Marianne?
	Speaker: chang	Listeners: pierce
grandpa?
	Speaker: chang	Listeners: shirley
Jackee?
	Speaker: chang	Listeners: abed
Kumar?
	Speaker: chang	Listeners: all
There's one asian stereotype that does apply to me. Whoever did this insulted my honor. And they've got 24 hours to come forward, Or mr. miyagi here will wax off everyone's score and the whole class gets a cero!
	Speaker: chang	Listeners: extra
'cept you, toby.
	Speaker: annie	Listeners: group
you're right! it's so unfair. And i can't handle this kind of stress right now.


	Speaker: troy	Listeners: group
the only difference between senor chang and stalin Is that i know who senor chang is.
	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: group
did you hear him call me jackee Like i'm some black female caricature? If the good lord hadn't been watching, I'd have slapped him upside the head.
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: group
who do you guys think cheated?
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: group
flattering. But if i'm gonna cheat, I'm not gonna write information from a book Onto a piece of paper. That's practically learning, for god's sakes. Whoever made that crib sheet wasn't a real cheater. Just...insecure and naive.
	Speaker: annie	Listeners: jeff
i may be naive, but i'm not stupid.
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: annie
well, i may be stupid, But i'm not trying to look like i'm not.
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: britta
well, i may be a genius, but i'm not a lesbian.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: group
Who cares who made the crib sheet? The only real cheater Is the guy who's threatening everyone with a zero.
	Speaker: annie	Listeners: group
I'm already overwhelmed by my duties On the school song committee.
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: annie
are you a musician?
	Speaker: annie	Listeners: pierce
eew. no. i hired a local composer. But he's quite a handful.
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: annie
well, i guess that's your fault, isn't it?
	Speaker: annie	Listeners: pierce
it is?
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: annie
you've got an accomplished Pianist and songwriter sitting 3 feet away from you. I wrote the jingle For hawthorne wipe's moist towelettes. I would have done your song for free. Smooth move, metamucil.


	Speaker: abed	Listeners: group
troy could do the school song. Troy invited rap music, And he's related to danny glover and president obama.
	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: abed
abed, have you been racist this whole time While i'm telling everybody at church What a sweet little caramel angel you are?
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: abed
hey, man, that stuff i said this morning wasn't true. I was just messin' with you.
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: troy
you were lying?
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: abed
yeah, as a joke. You've never had anybody mess with you before?
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: troy
yes. just kidding. no. like that? This isn't a table. Ha ha! that's funny.


	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: britta
remember when we used to study spanish?


	Speaker: annie	Listeners: pierce
pierce!
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: annie
yo.
	Speaker: annie	Listeners: pierce
i talked to the dean, And he said you can write greendale's school song.
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: annie
well, that's more like it.
	Speaker: annie	Listeners: pierce
you know the statue dedication is this friday. So you have to have it done by then.
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: annie
this friday? this friday?
	Speaker: annie	Listeners: pierce
if that's not enough time--
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: annie
no, no, no! You really don't know much about genius, do you? Yes, i can do it by friday.
	Speaker: annie	Listeners: pierce
great! There's a piano in the rehearsal space, And i'll help you out however i can. You're gonna do an awesome job!
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: annie
i know!


	Speaker: chang	Listeners: all
so...this is the last chance For the cheater to be an adult and face la musica... Or everyone fails.
	Speaker: annie	Listeners: chang
no!
	Speaker: chang	Listeners: all
you got ten seconds... Starting now.
	Speaker: annie	Listeners: all
no! I've never... gotten a zero before.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: chang
i did it.
	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: britta
Britta!
	Speaker: chang	Listeners: britta
well, you really took your sweet time with that one, baby.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: chang
how dare you terrorize a class by threatening their grades. It's not that easy to get human beings to turn on each other.
	Speaker: chang	Listeners: all
turn on her!
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: all
ow! real mature!
	Speaker: chang	Listeners: britta
that's right. we are mature! Too mature to sit in a class With a cheating, lying poop-face!
	Speaker: chang	Listeners: all
Okay. time to learn some formal greetings.


	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: britta
so... Wow.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: jeff
yeah, i bet you're enjoying this.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: britta
yeah, well, when we first met, Like you were up here and i was here, and now... Oh, wait, i gave a quarter to a dirty bum today.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: jeff
what do you think they're gonna do to me?
	Speaker: dean	Listeners: britta
well, we're not gonna buy you an ice cream. Hi. dean pelton. What an entrance i got to make there. You would be Britta perry. I just spoke with senor chang, And i'm afraid greendale takes this kinda thing Very seriously.
	Speaker: dean	Listeners: all
much like a university would!
	Speaker: dean	Listeners: britta
Your case will be reviewed By a disciplinary tribunal tomorrow In borchart hall. You could be facing expulsion.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: dean
isn't borchart hall the pool?
	Speaker: dean	Listeners: jeff
there is an olympic-sized pool there, yes,
	Speaker: dean	Listeners: all
But we will be next to it, using its $6,000 judge's table!
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: dean
uh, is she allowed to have counsel? I mean, i may not be a practicing lawyer anymore, But relative to this place, i'm alan dershowitz.
	Speaker: dean	Listeners: jeff
oh, okay, ouch, and yes. If you'd like, you may represent her. Dean you later.


	Speaker: britta	Listeners: jeff
i'm not gonna sit while some hokey tribunal Gets its jollies judging me.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: britta
hey, if you show up with me, follow my lead, And deny everything, you'll walk. That's the winger guarantee.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: jeff
i get it. You think you're gonna save my bacon Using your lawyer powers And send me into fits of grateful arousal.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: britta
i can neither confirm nor deny that. See how good i am?


	Speaker: abed	Listeners: troy
hey, troy. did you hear? All dogs are blue now. Every single dog in the world is blue. I'm just messing with you.
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: abed
yeah, i know, but let me explain to you A few things about how this works. Uh, first of all, i cannot be got, Because i am not gullible like you. Secondly, you are not good at this, Because you are not believable in your face, okay? Your face? it's bad.
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: troy
okay.
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: abed
um, also... You gotta ride the line between believable and-- what are you writing in?
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: troy
it's a notepad.
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: abed
yeah, but what are-- what language?
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: troy
it's probably arabic.


	Speaker: dean	Listeners: all
all right, i am convening this disciplinary tribunal At our state-of-the-art judge's table, Which has its own built-in sound system, So take that yale. Our judges include myself, uh, dean craig pelton.
	Speaker: duncan	Listeners: all
professor ian duncan.
	Speaker: chang	Listeners: all
professor ben chang.
	Speaker: duncan	Listeners: chang
uh, no, you're a teacher. you're not a professor.
	Speaker: chang	Listeners: duncan
maybe because i don't look like ron weasley.
	Speaker: duncan	Listeners: chang
that's the difference. That's the qualifying factor. gentlemen, point of order.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: duncan dean chang
How can senor chang be one of the judges? He's the one accusing my client.
	Speaker: chang	Listeners: jeff duncan
yeah, well, you got prince charles over here, Who's your drinking buddy.
	Speaker: duncan	Listeners: chang
oh, got me.
	Speaker: dean	Listeners: jeff
well, it sounds like there are two biases, One on each side, and i go both ways. Oh, let's strike that.
	Speaker: dean	Listeners: extra
Lashonda, can we please strike that?
	Speaker: dean	Listeners: jeff
I am impartial, so it should all work out. Okay. let's begin.
	Speaker: duncan	Listeners: chang
fine. the tribunal calls teacher chang.
	Speaker: chang	Listeners: duncan
okay, just keep it up frost/nixon.
	Speaker: duncan	Listeners: chang
i was planning on doing that. Cleared my whole day. Uh, mr. chang, could you remind us Of the events of yesterday?
	Speaker: chang	Listeners: all
with great pleasure. it was a tuesday, Uh, crack of dawn, 5:58 a.m. I got up, i took my morning deuce, I made a breakfast consisting of..


	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: self
* green-dale * * green-dale * * slop *  Mm, nah. * green * * gree--green * * greendale isn't a slop pail *
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: annie
hi, almost done.
	Speaker: annie	Listeners: pierce
oh, good.
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: annie
you can tell the dean i'll have a song That'll make the devil poop god's pants.
	Speaker: annie	Listeners: pierce
that's exciting. Mind if i hear what you got so far?
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: annie
well, uh, yeah, sure. I, uh--i'll probably open with something like this. uh... You know, a note like that. And end with a note like that. Uh, the words, i can't tell you. You know, the rest is really a surprise.
	Speaker: annie	Listeners: pierce
i'm just a little worried. I keep hearing the same two notes, And your sheet music Looks like a chinese takeout menu.
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: annie
a musician sees music in everything, annie. I mean, it could be... * moo shoo pork * * squab with lettuce * * You see? i mean, it just comes out. You know what? you really shouldn't be here right now.
	Speaker: annie	Listeners: pierce
what?
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: annie
you are inside a throbbing, cosmic womb Of creativity, And when this baby starts kicking, I cannot be responsible for your sanity. i know it sounds funny, But let me play you out, okay? Playing you out now, this song. You know, like on stage? playing you out, okay? Thanks for coming. bye-bye.


	Speaker: chang	Listeners: all
and then she yelled, "screw you," Or, "screw education," or something like that, And then she stormed out of the room In her high-heel boots like it was tampon time... If you know what i mean.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: all
objection. i don't know what he means.
	Speaker: duncan	Listeners: jeff
please don't encourage him, winger. Do you have any more questions?
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: all
the defense calls Britta perry.
	Speaker: dean	Listeners: britta
now, are those the high-heel boots He was talking about?
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: dean
yes.
	Speaker: dean	Listeners: britta
are they comfortable?
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: dean
yeah.
	Speaker: dean	Listeners: britta
i'm just curious. they're cute.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: dean
thank you.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: britta
miss perry... Did you make that crib sheet?
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: jeff
no.
	Speaker: chang	Listeners: jeff
she confessed!
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: chang
she confessed to protect her classmates, Because you were threatening to flunk everyone!
	Speaker: duncan	Listeners: chang
you did what?
	Speaker: chang	Listeners: duncan
oh, shut your pompous vortex of overlapping fangs!
	Speaker: duncan	Listeners: chang
hey, british dentistry is not on trial.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: dean
dean pelton, i move this case Be thrown out of... The pool area!
	Speaker: dean	Listeners: all
well, it certainly--
	Speaker: dean	Listeners: all
Well, it certainly sounds to me That this young lady's only crime Is being a hero and wanting to be taller. This tribunal is adjourned.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: all
wait! i cheated!
	Speaker: dean	Listeners: all
and we're back.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: all
objection. my client did not cheat.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: all
yes, i did.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: all
yes, she did... But why? That's the real question, isn't it? The world wasn't the only thing that changed On september 11th.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: jeff
Jeff, come on.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: all
five-minute recess?
	Speaker: dean	Listeners: all
no, no. there's nothing In the bylaws about recesses, all right? The wheels of justice here don't stop Just because you--aah! Time out! time out! Save the table! save the table!


	Speaker: abed	Listeners: self
Beginning transmission. The primary purpose seems to be male bonding, And the attitude during conveyance Of the random deceit is apparently of great importance. The humanoid is approximately 5'10" in height.
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: abed
what are you doing?
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: troy
oh, hey. troy. I didn't see you. Um, how long were you standing there?
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: abed
you trying to mess with me?
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: troy
yes, that's what i was doing. You got me. I was just messing with you, but i guess i blew it again.
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: abed
yeah. You did.
	Speaker: chang	Listeners: duncan
man, don't turn your back on me.


	Speaker: duncan	Listeners: chang
it is on like donkey kong! Have you got a problem with me?
	Speaker: chang	Listeners: duncan
i don't like the fact that you're walking around here Like you're better than me in front of my students.
	Speaker: duncan	Listeners: chang
i'm sorry. do you mind if we have this conversation In a room with less balls?
	Speaker: duncan	Listeners: extra
You're very confident, i'll say that.
	Speaker: chang	Listeners: extra
but you shouldn't be.


	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: britta
what are you doing out there?
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: jeff
you know i have a problem with dishonesty.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: britta
you're on trial for cheating! Fa--look, we'll be fine. I just have to go back out there And make the case that you're a good person--
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: jeff
you don't know that. You're just doing all of this 'cause you want to sleep with me I mean, you said it yourself. You don't even want to be my friend.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: britta
wait a minute. Wait, is that what you thought i meant? Britta, look at me. Look at me!
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: jeff
i am.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: britta
no, look how handsome my face is. If all i wanted was sex, I could get it from plenty of women Without having to go through all this crap. I'm here because i like you, And i--i'd be psyched to be your friend. I just didn't want to take sex off the table Without doing my due diligence.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: jeff
i actually believe you.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: britta
well, why wouldn't you?
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: jeff
i don't know. I guess...same reason that i cheated. I...just have more experience being worthless. I think i left that crib sheet on the floor Because i wanted to get caught. I'm so used to screwing everything up I just wanted to get it over with.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: britta
wait. i think we have our defense.


	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: all
Gentlemen... My client is insane.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: jeff
what?
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: all
gentlemen, i'm sure you suspected... That ms. perry was pretty odd before the recess. But if you could've heard all the stuff She just told me in the shower, You would realize she is all the way out Of her entire damn mind. She doesn't want to succeed Because she doesn't think she can. So she goes out of her way to fail. That's crazy! But... Do we really want to make it a crime To be crazy at greendale? I mean, look at us. I mean, you two are arguing about status at a college That correspondence schools make fun of. Dean, you want so bad for this place to be ivy league That you are putting us at risk of electrocution. Everyone on this campus is nuts.


	Speaker: leonard	Listeners: jeff
not me!
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: leonard
oh, come on, leonard. If you're gonna argue with me, put on a bathing suit.
	Speaker: leonard	Listeners: jeff
busted.


	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: all
if you want to rehabilitate your fellow inmate, you need to sentence her to staying here with us. Because if crazy people can't be at greendale, Where are we supposed to go?
	Speaker: duncan	Listeners: all
Wow, well, under the circumstances I'll recommend that the accused Be fully exonerated. On the condition that she receives Psychological counseling on a weekly basis From a trained mental health professional. Thinking maybe fridays, nine-ish, something like that.
	Speaker: duncan	Listeners: dean chang
All in favor say "aye."
	Speaker: dean	Listeners: duncan
aye.
	Speaker: chang	Listeners: duncan
aye.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: self
yes!
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: duncan
wait, what?
	Speaker: duncan	Listeners: britta
that just happened.

	Speaker: abed	Listeners: troy
whoa, whoa, whoa. I'm not an alien.
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: abed

	Speaker: abed	Listeners: troy
yeah.
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: abed
it would be less creepy If you were actually an alien.
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: troy

You're not very pretty, you have no boobs, And you can't do a basket toss to save your life, But you made a commitment. So pick up your pompoms, pierce, Stuff your bra, and get ready for the team bus To forget you at a taco bell, because life is tough. But we soldier on, And that's just the way it goes. gonna play myself out.

	Speaker: troy	Listeners: annie
i used a memory technique. dwarves hate being called midgets, and midgets are small.


	Speaker: dean	Listeners: group
hi, everybody. well, look at this group having some kind of meeting and being so diverse. there is just--boy! there is just one of every kind of you, isn't there?
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: dean
well, we are missing a pipsqueak, but we don't want one, so beat it.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: pierce
um, pierce, that's the dean.
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: britta
are you kidding?
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: pierce
mm-mm.
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: dean
sorry. just my luck.
	Speaker: dean	Listeners: group
it's all right. don't let me interrupt. sometimes i just roll around campus like a little football. i can't believe this. here i am in a random conversation about football, and i'm talking to troy barnes, star quarterback from riverside high...whoa.
	Speaker: dean	Listeners: troy
troy, did you know that greendale has a football team?
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: troy
did you know they had a football?
	Speaker: dean	Listeners: jeff
ha. that's very funny.
	Speaker: dean	Listeners: troy
troy, i was so sorry to hear about your injury. but now that you have recovered, we would love for you to play for the human beings.
	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: dean
the team's name is the human beings?
	Speaker: dean	Listeners: shirley
yeah. my idea. it was the greendale grizzlies, but i thought that, um... well, a lot of these students have been called animals their whole lives. unfortunately, i don't know what to do about the mascot.
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: dean
oh, i can help you with that, your honor. i have a wealth of experience in image management, icon development, and y2k preparedness.
	Speaker: dean	Listeners: pierce
well, aren't you found money
	Speaker: dean	Listeners: troy
troy, all of your friends are lining up to turn greendale around. how about you?
	Speaker: annie	Listeners: dean
troy isn't interested in football anymore. getting injured in that keg stand was the best thing that ever happened to him.
	Speaker: dean	Listeners: annie
whoa! yoko ono much?
	Speaker: dean	Listeners: troy
bros before hoes, troy.
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: dean
listen, man. no offense, but i was the best, and i finished on top. i wouldn't play for this school with a 10-foot pole.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: dean
dean, i'm sure troy will sign up for football if and when some accident damages the part of his brain that feels pride. until then, would you excuse us?
	Speaker: dean	Listeners: troy
all right, well, uh... if you change your mind, the field is always open. oh, figuratively speaking. you know, wednesdays and sundays it's used as parking overflow for the mega-church. okay.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: group
now let's meet the minimum requirements for a language credit, shall we?


	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: group
yes, but i need to go to the bathroom first.
	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: britta
uh, britta?
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: shirley
oh, no, i don't have to go.
	Speaker: annie	Listeners: shirley
i'll go with you.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: jeff
what? she's offended?
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: britta
girls go in groups. did you learn nothing from stand-up comedy in the '90s?
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: jeff
i'm familiar with the concept. i'm just-- fine. if it's important to shirley, i'll go with her next time. i'm willing to try some more mainstream feminine stuff.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: britta
well, then you should know that nothing says "i'm a woman" like doing it with me.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: jeff
nothing says, "i'm a pig" like you.
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: group
will they or won't they? sexual tension.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: abed
abed, it makes the group uncomfortable when you talk about us like we're characters in a show you're watching.
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: jeff
well, that's sort of my gimmick. but we did lean on that pretty hard last week. i can lay low for an episode.


	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: troy
you sure you made the right call on the football team, troy? it looks like they won something once. "most valued customer. henderson trophy cases."
	Speaker: annie	Listeners: troy
so we should still study a little more astronomy later, right? maybe over some milky ways or some mars bars.
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: annie
or pancakes!


	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: self
"i'm jeff. and i'm a student at greendale." that's not good.


	Speaker: extra	Listeners: all
wood undergoes rapid oxidation because it reacts spontaneously to-- okay, guys, seriously, we've talked about this, okay? you have got to turn off your cell-- that's mine. my bad.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: shirley
i'm going to the bathroom. would you like to come with me?
	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: britta
well, yes, yes, i would. oh, that's nice!
	Speaker: extra	Listeners: extra
okay, what's it called? antoni--an--hold on. does anyone have a pen? pen?
	Speaker: extra	Listeners: all
no one has a pen. why would you not bring a pen to class? idiot.
	Speaker: extra	Listeners: extra
no, you're not an idiot.


	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: britta
i had my blinker on about five minutes, and this no-good, clearly bald but trying to hide it with a bandana loser swooped right in. i couldn't believe it.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: shirley
maybe he didn't see you.
	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: britta
he saw me!
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: shirley
maybe he had his blinker on too.
	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: britta
maybe. so you... got any family, britta?
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: shirley
yeah, whatever.
	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: britta
think my mom might visit this weekend. she and i are gonna get makeovers at that spa--
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: shirley
makeovers. they sure have us programmed, right? i am a female pleasure unit. i require a new coat of paint.
	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: britta
just something i thought might be fun.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: shirley
here's something i think might be fun. let's find out the number of makeup companies that are owned by women. i'll save you the trouble. it's zero. but of course you're saying, "britta, aren't you a hypocrite? "you're plastered with glitter and goo from head to toe, just like the rest of us." well, i also pay income tax and pull over for cops, but that doesn't mean i support--


	Speaker: dean	Listeners: pierce
thanks for offering to help design the new mascot. i, uh, have been a little stumped.
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: dean
that's no problem. by the way, i took the liberty of thumbnailing a human being prototype which i modeled after da vinci's vitruvian man. the penis is a little small, i think.
	Speaker: dean	Listeners: pierce
oh, i think it's-- oh. okay. it...looks a lot like you. um, here's the thing. if we are the human beings, you know, and we have a mascot that's just a white guy, what message are we sending? our symbol needs to reflect the diversity of our school and our species.
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: dean
so...black?
	Speaker: dean	Listeners: pierce
no. no, because we're not the greendale blacks, mr. hawthorne, or the greendale asians or any other creed. we are the greendale human beings.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: pierce dean
sorry to disturb you guys... who are clearly looking at a naked drawing of pierce doing jumping jacks.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: dean
dean, a quick download, please?
	Speaker: dean	Listeners: jeff
uh, absolutely.
	Speaker: dean	Listeners: pierce
excuse me.
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: dean
okay. fill me in later.
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: self
ah. whoa-oh. i'll go with a pencil.


	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: dean
first of all...
	Speaker: dean	Listeners: jeff
mm-hmm.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: dean
i'm flattered.
	Speaker: dean	Listeners: jeff
oh, well. you're a very photogenic man. is that real bed head, or do you put something in there? can i? oh, it's crispy.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: dean
i was thinking about the four disembodied heads, and i thought, where's the heart? where's the soul? where's the different poster design?
	Speaker: dean	Listeners: jeff
you know, i did think those were less than personable, which is why i went with the full bodies in these mailers we have going out.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: dean
mailers? i didn't give permission for this.
	Speaker: dean	Listeners: jeff
jeffrey, did you not read the release agreement on the back of your registration form? i'm starting to see why someone used to be a lawyer. ha ha! up top!
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: dean
if someone from the outside were to find-- okay, if someone from the outside were to find out that i am a student at a community college, that could have a negative impact on my future career.
	Speaker: dean	Listeners: jeff
oh. goodness. look what we have stumbled onto-- an opportunity to help each other out. i suppose i wouldn't need this promotional campaign if i could announce to the press that troy barnes is playing football here.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: dean
i think he's been pretty clear about declining that offer.
	Speaker: dean	Listeners: jeff
i think if you said, "jump," he'd say, "how high?" if you said, "stop," he'd say, "hammertime." you starting to get what i mean?
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: dean
no. i need another example.
	Speaker: dean	Listeners: jeff
you know, i didn't... realize before, but we should send those out to local businesses. hmm? law firms. lawyer... companies? legal... gatherings?
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: dean
are you trying to blackmail me?
	Speaker: dean	Listeners: jeff
i think so.


	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: jeff dean
gentlemen... i present to you the greendale human being.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: pierce
that's a falcon with a gun. now it's a falcon with an erection.


	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: abed
Hi Abed	
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: abed
hi
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: troy annie
He's just laying low


	Speaker: britta	Listeners: shirley
Wait, are you going to the bathroom?
	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: britta
uh, yes
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: shirley
I'll go with you
	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: britta
blue bird day to shred some pow. you know what? I'm good
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: annie troy
She probably just... you know... had to go number two


	Speaker: annie	Listeners: troy
Ok, what's the closest planet to Earth?
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: annie
Planet Hollywood
	Speaker: annie	Listeners: troy
That's not the right answer, but it shows how fun the astronomy can be!
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: troy
Hey Troy, can I talk to you for a second?
	Speaker: annie	Listeners: jeff
We are studying, so Troy is busy
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: annie
Well the galaxy is not going anywhere, I'll bring him back


	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: troy
Do you ever miss being a quarterback, Troy?
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: jeff
I miss being the best at something, miss having a coach I miss knowing what to think
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: troy
You still know what to think, Troy
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: jeff
Oh good
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: troy
For instance, after Dean talked about you playing football, you and I were thinking the same thing
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: jeff
That dude looks like Moby
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: troy
You were thinking, what if Troy did play for Greendale You'd be surprised how many of your favorite football players got started at community college
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: jeff
Oh really? Name one
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: troy
Who's your favorite player?
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: jeff
Me. Woah
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: troy
Maybe you and I should checkout the Greendale Thunderdome
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: troy
the dome arrives later. it comes with thunder. let me tell you a little secret about me, troy. every day on my way to school, i drive through downtown past the courthouse just to get a glimpse of the world that i once ruled. and i just wanna jump out of my car, run up the steps and... exploit the legal system for profit. but i can't. i'm locked out of my old kingdom. you're not. you see what i'm saying?
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: jeff
you're saying i could be a lawyer.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: troy
i'm saying you're a football player! it's in your blood!
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: jeff
that's racist!
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: troy
your soul.
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: jeff
that's racist.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: troy
your eyes?
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: jeff
that's gay?
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: troy
that's homophobic.
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: jeff
that's black.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: troy
that's racist!
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: jeff
damn.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: troy
when you played, you were a god. now you're not playing, and you're not. i'd tell you to do the math, but math isn't important. the only thing that's important is this.
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: jeff
yeah, but annie said--
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: troy
annie said that benjamin button was compelling. look, she's a smart girl, but sometimes she's just wrong.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: extra
85--go long!
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: troy
it's like a drug, isn't it? feel it, troy. throw it! the scoreboard lights up. there will be a scoreboard there. it's complete!
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: extra
nice catch!
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: troy
the girls, the glory, the scouts, the career! it starts when you join this team.
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: jeff
is that linebacker a pregnant woman?
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: troy
look, you can meet them later. but this decision has to be yours, t-bone. and this decision has to be yes.
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: jeff
how did you know my nickname's t-bone?
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: troy
because you're a football player, and your name begins with "t." your name begins with "t."


	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: britta
britta?
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: shirley
oh. are you finished? i mean, i have to go, but apparently, i failed yesterday's tryouts for the position of bathroom companion.
	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: britta
oh, britta, i wasn't trying to hurt your feelings.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: shirley
you didn't hurt my feelings, shirley. i don't need to go to the bathroom with other people. i was just trying to throw you a bone because i like you.
	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: britta
oh. you can keep that bone. listening to a story about a stranger pissing me off and taking the stranger's side? and then you can't talk about your own business, but you insinuate my mama's a robot because she and i want makeovers. that is the ladies' room, britta, a place where ladies go to share, listen, support each other and... discreetly eliminate waste. and i like you too. even like that you're a little hard. but if you can't learn to be soft in there, you need to pee alone.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: shirley
i've peed alone my whole life. women have always hated me. i don't even know how it started. maybe it was when i got boobs before everyb--
	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: britta
shh, shh, shh. not out here. in there.


	Speaker: troy	Listeners: extra
whoo! ha ha! troy, troy, the wonder boy! you dropped your books, poindexter. yeah!
	Speaker: annie	Listeners: troy
troy, i've been waiting for an hour.
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: annie
it's all right, i'm worth it. * hip, hop, body don't stop *
	Speaker: annie	Listeners: troy
troy. why are you doing a politically conservative high school shamefully outdated fight rap? have you been playing football?
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: annie
threw the skin around a couple of times. still got it. eh...eh...eh...eh... doosh!
	Speaker: annie	Listeners: troy
but you knew we had an astronomy test tomorrow.
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: annie
class blows. what i need to know about the universe is that i'm at the center of it.
	Speaker: annie	Listeners: troy
troy! stop! don't become this person again. this isn't the real you. this is the arrogant jock that totally ignored the only people that truly liked him for non-superficial reasons but weren't allowed to say anything because their parents are bigots! football is bad for you, troy.
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: annie
jeff said you'd say that.
	Speaker: annie	Listeners: troy
jeff...what now?
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: self
troy! troy, troy, troy. that's my name.


	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: dean
i think if we add in a little bit of phylicia rashad we'll be in better shape.
	Speaker: dean	Listeners: pierce
yeah, you're right. that beige is a little light.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: dean pierce
wow.
	Speaker: dean	Listeners: jeff
yeah. yeah. we are developing the perfect mascot. no stereotypical identifiers from any race or gender.
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: jeff
see, jeff, this is a chart of the features we're staying away from-- pan-asian eye folds, irish chins, women's breasts.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: dean pierce
is that seal?
	Speaker: dean	Listeners: jeff
that is our human color wheel. it goes from seal to seal's teeth. what do you think?
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: dean
i think not being racist is the new racism.
	Speaker: dean	Listeners: pierce
whoa, whoa, whoa-- what happened to the prototype?
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: dean
ooh! i left the nose in the kiln.


	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: dean
so...troy is gonna play football.
	Speaker: dean	Listeners: jeff
yes!
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: dean
which means i'll be getting rid of these.
	Speaker: dean	Listeners: jeff
no. i won't mail these out, but they are staying with me until the press announces that troy is a part of the team. and i want him at that pep rally tonight. reporters are gonna be there. we're gonna unveil the new mascot. and things are finally going to start turning around. oh, and...my ex-therapist is gonna think twice before he makes fun of my job!


	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: dean
here it is. still hot.
	Speaker: dean	Listeners: pierce
ooh. ow.
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: dean
oh, dean, i'm gonna get some more coffee. you want anything?
	Speaker: dean	Listeners: pierce
oh, yeah, a desmond tutu with just enough cream to make it a lou diamond phillips.
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: dean
la bamba. got it.


	Speaker: annie	Listeners: jeff
i've been following you. how much did the dean pay you to make troy play football?
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: annie
i'm not having a conversation with someone who emerges from a bush.
	Speaker: annie	Listeners: jeff
because i'm right?
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: annie
no. because i'm not in a commercial for breakfast cereal. look...the dean has pictures of me, okay? horrible pictures of me... attending his school.
	Speaker: annie	Listeners: jeff
and for that you'd convince troy to flush his life down football's toilet again? britta's right, you are the most selfish person alive! and all that is gonna end right now. because i'm telling him what kind of friend you really are.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: annie
maybe you should tell him you're hopelessly in love with him. high school must have been tough, huh? waiting for a superstar to notice you. but here...here... he's all alone, and he needs so much help! did you enroll in all of his classes, or were you worried that might freak him out? the important thing is that you are there for him. the important thing is that you are the only one there for him. and you don't really care what he wants... just as long as you don't have to share him with the rest of the world. because, really, you are just as selfish as i am. you're just not as good at it yet.
	Speaker: annie	Listeners: jeff
you're right. i could never be as good as you. probably because i actually care.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: annie
profound, but technically meaningless. and don't bother trying that thing that women do where they walk away and make the guy feel like crap, because it won't happen! yeah!
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: self
damn it.


	Speaker: annie	Listeners: shirley
shirley, will you please come to the bathroom with me?
	Speaker: annie	Listeners: britta
where's shirley?
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: annie
shirley's not coming. but i'm here... to listen...girl.
	Speaker: annie	Listeners: britta
why do we inflict so much pain on ourselves for men?
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: annie
i don't-- know...sweetie. maybe...it's because men make the world go round? kleenex?
	Speaker: annie	Listeners: britta
i've been... infatuated with troy. now he's joining football. now he'll have his pick of the litter and... i'll never get to be with him!
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: annie
oh, annie, screw him! there are guys out there that would kill to be with you. and if troy isn't one of them, that's him failing your standards. you got that?
	Speaker: annie	Listeners: britta
you're right. i can't control him. and if i truly cared about him, i wouldn't want to. thanks for talking to me, britta. it really helped.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: annie
seriously?
	Speaker: annie	Listeners: britta
yes.
	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: britta
who's my girl?
	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: annie
'scuse me!
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: shirley
i did it, i did it!
	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: britta
oh, yes, you did!


	Speaker: troy	Listeners: jeff
troy! troy! don't go in there, man.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: troy
what?
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: troy
you got the most you were ever gonna get out of football in high school. a life of disillusionment and depression begins on the other side of that door.
	Speaker: extra	Listeners: jeff
hey, man...is this your first pep rally or something?
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: jeff
you told me football was the most important thing in the world.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: troy
well, buckle up, troy. i was exaggerating. it's kinda my gimmick. let me tell you something--
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: jeff
no, let me tell you something. you know that keg flip that cost me my scholarship?
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: troy
yeah.
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: jeff
i hurt myself on purpose.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: troy
what?
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: jeff
there was a scout coming to the final game at riverside and...i couldn't take the pressure, so i took the easy way out. but when you showed me that field, i saw there was nothing to worry about here. i could just play football for the fun of it. i mean, have you seen these guys? there is nowhere to go but up.
	Speaker: extra	Listeners: troy
dude, we have feelings.
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: jeff
i don't know about you, but i know i ended up here because things weren't that great out there. you should try accepting where you're at, man. take a pottery class or something.
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: all
greendale, we're number one! nancy pelosi is no fun!


	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: annie
hey.
	Speaker: annie	Listeners: jeff
hey. i've decided to support troy. they deploy things in football, right? i went for rhyme over clarity.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: annie
look, i'm, uh...i'm really sorry about before. i just think we were both wrong.
	Speaker: annie	Listeners: jeff
really? because i'm an 18-year-old girl, and you made me cry in public.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: annie
mm. okay, maybe i was a little more wrong. i should grow up and make peace with being here. i mean, it's not like greendale's gonna kill me or anything.


	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: humanbeing
holy crap!
	Speaker: annie	Listeners: humanbeing
aah!
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: jeff annie
oh, sorry. hey, say hello to our ethnically neutral mascot-- the greendale human being. the costume makes it difficult for him to see.
	Speaker: dean	Listeners: jeff annie
he can't move his mouth either. but take it from me, that's human for "hello."
	Speaker: dean	Listeners: humanbeing
let's get you into the pep rally!
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: humanbeing
great idea. let's do it!
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: dean
we've solved racism. what's next?
	Speaker: dean	Listeners: pierce
uh, let's do something for little people. ooh! or albinos!
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: dean
little albinos.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: annie
this has the potential to be a uniquely greendale experience. milady.

Bernoulli's one of my favorites. Little-known fact, statistics were not his only love. He's also famous for his French sauce used on meat and poultry.
	Speaker: slater	Listeners: jeff
That's Bearnaise.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: slater
Oh, we may need to settle this at a restaurant.
	Speaker: slater	Listeners: jeff
It's cute. A little aggressive, but as a busy, confident woman of authority, I'm attracted to men who take charge.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: slater
Are you being sarcastic, or am I nailing it?
	Speaker: slater	Listeners: jeff
You were nailing it, until you had to ask.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: slater
Oh, damn it. Starting over. Hey, you in the skirt, date me.
	Speaker: slater	Listeners: jeff
I'd like to, Mr. Winger. You're tall, you dress nice, and I've graded enough of your tests to know I'd never feel mentally inadequate.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: slater
Thank you.
	Speaker: slater	Listeners: jeff
Only problem, I don't date students.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: slater
You know if you agree to go out with me...


	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: shirley britta
Oh, hey. Awkward. How small is this campus?
	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: jeff
Bastard.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: shirley
It's fine. I don't care.
	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: britta
It's disgusting the way men behave. Did you ever see that Katherine Heigl movie poster where Gerard Butler had that heart over his weiner? That resonated with me.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: shirley
Okay, fine. But just to repeat, I don't care what Jeff does.
	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: jeff
Bastard.


	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: slater
I'm barely a student. I'm older than you. I drive a Lexus. I saw "Ghost Busters" in the theater. Look, my gums are receding.
	Speaker: slater	Listeners: jeff
It's uncanny how many of my buttons you're finding, but I have a personal rule about this, and I stick to it.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: slater
Have a cup of coffee with me. I bet I can change your mind.
	Speaker: slater	Listeners: jeff
Oh, I know you can. That's why you're not getting the chance.
	Speaker: leonard	Listeners: jeff
Ooh, whoo.


	Speaker: annie	Listeners: jeff
Are you coming to my Dias de los Muertos party?
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: annie
I'm definitely gonna try to swing by.
	Speaker: annie	Listeners: jeff
Then I can mark you down as definitely being there from 7:00 sharp till upside-down Spanish question mark?
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: annie
Here's the thing...
	Speaker: annie	Listeners: jeff
No, here's the thing. I am putting my foot down. You understand? I am being assertive, and I am making eye contact, and it is achieving results.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: annie
Are you trying to get formidable with me?
	Speaker: annie	Listeners: jeff
It worked on Pierce.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: annie
Infomercials work on Pierce.
	Speaker: annie	Listeners: jeff
Jeff, you're the cool guy, okay?
	Speaker: annie	Listeners: jeff
If you show up, it'll be the first party I host where everyone doesn't say they need to get home in time for the news.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: annie
This won't work. The last time you did this, I saved a vial of your tears and have been slowly building up an immunity.
	Speaker: annie	Listeners: jeff
I was so unpopular in high school, the crossing guard used to lure me into traffic. This party is a second chance to be... Hip. Cool! Laidback!
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: annie
Look, I will come to your party.
	Speaker: annie	Listeners: jeff
Thank you. I'm putting you down for two bags of ice and a sleeve of paper cups.


	Speaker: abed	Listeners: pierce
Taking a pill?
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: abed
Yes, I am.
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: pierce
Xenolovaden. My grandpa took that when he was around your age.
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: abed
Fantastic.
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: pierce
But by the time grandpa got up in years, his memory wasn't great. He'd mix the wrong pills. You know how old people are?
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: abed
Heard stories about it, yeah.
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: pierce
One time he started hallucinating and ran down the street with no pants on. Which in the Gaza Strip is considered a real party foul, so you should probably be careful...
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: abed
Look, I really don't need your advice, and I'm not your pantsless grandpa.
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: self
Pantsless grandpa.


	Speaker: annie	Listeners: extra
Hola!
	Speaker: annie	Listeners: extra
Scary.
	Speaker: annie	Listeners: extra
Oh, cute! Cute.
	Speaker: annie	Listeners: britta
Oh, Britta. You look adorable.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: annie
Thank you. I hate when women use Halloween as an excuse to dress up like sluts, you know?
	Speaker: annie	Listeners: britta
Yeah.


	Speaker: annie	Listeners: all
Okay, everyone. I think we can begin. I've got everyone's personalized cookie tombstones, por tradicion, and in a few minutes, we're going to start the dance of the dead... La danza de los muertos.
	Speaker: chang	Listeners: annie
You don't have to keep doing that!
	Speaker: annie	Listeners: all
Party on.


	Speaker: britta	Listeners: jeff
It's nice of you to be here. Sure you'd rather be out with your hot professor.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: britta
Well, it's funny, I enrolled here as selfish loner, but you and the group have given me a crash course in friendship.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: jeff
She blew you off, huh?
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: britta
She's grading papers.
	Speaker: chang	Listeners: jeff
Professor Slater? She's not grading papers. She's at the faculty party in the cafeteria.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: chang
Oh, look, it's the eavesdropping matador.
	Speaker: chang	Listeners: jeff
Are you saying my people are sneaky?
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: chang
What?


	Speaker: abed	Listeners: jeff
There's a storm building on the horizon, but you and I will save the night. Chex mix, pretzels, baby carrots, predictable but appetizing.
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: abed
Hey.
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: troy
Hey.
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: abed
Can I ask you something I always wanted to ask the real Batman?
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: troy
Yeah.
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: abed
Am I good looking?
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: troy
You're a very attractive young man.
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: abed
I knew it.


	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: all
Let's get this party started!
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: pierce
Who are you?
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: britta
I am the Beastmaster. From the movie Beastmaster. What rock have you been living under?
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: jeff
What are you going as? A gay douchebag? Just kidding.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: pierce
Nice one. I'm not much of a costume guy.
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: jeff
I know, you're not much of a liking the ladies guy either, huh? Oop. Body blow. Is that liquor?


	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: jeff britta
Hello. Here's your drinks, mates.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: shirley
Oh, thanks, Urkel.
	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: jeff
I'm Harry Potter.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: shirley
Really?
	Speaker: chang	Listeners: shirley
What up, Urkel?


	Speaker: starburns	Listeners: pierce
Hey.
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: self
Oh...
	Speaker: starburns	Listeners: pierce
All right. What are you taking?
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: starburns
You know, the usual cool stuff. I've got 'ludes, uh, dreamers... Johnny boys.
	Speaker: starburns	Listeners: pierce
Tell you what. I'll trade you one of mine for two of yours. Hmm?
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: starburns
I don't know, Starburns. I'm...
	Speaker: starburns	Listeners: pierce
Oh, sorry. I thought I was dealing with the Beastmaster.
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: starburns
Hey, hey, who said you weren't? Saddle up, fruit pie.
	Speaker: starburns	Listeners: pierce
I don't mind if I do, may I?


	Speaker: chang	Listeners: jeff
Here. take this. Give anyone that shows up their stupid credit.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: chang
You going to the faculty party? Make me your plus one.
	Speaker: chang	Listeners: jeff
Ah, give it up, Winger. Professor Slater doesn't date students. Or married Asians who drive Mopeds.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: chang
Give you 20 bucks.
	Speaker: chang	Listeners: jeff
I'll bring the hog around.


	Speaker: annie	Listeners: all
Okay, it's time for the "dance of the dead". Everyone form a circle. Lights. Music.
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: annie
Is it under genre or on a specific playlist?


	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: starburns
Hey, uh, man? What'd you slip me? I keep grinding my teeth, and I want to kiss everybody.
	Speaker: starburns	Listeners: pierce
What'd you slip me, man? My heart stopped racing, and I can't pee.


	Speaker: annie	Listeners: all
Now for the first dance, I'd like to invite a very special guest to the floor. Jeff Winger? Jeff? Where's Jeff?
	Speaker: starburns	Listeners: all
Is Jeff gone? You know, I'm gonna go. I don't want to miss the news.
	Speaker: annie	Listeners: self
News!
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: annie
He just stepped out. He's gonna be right back.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: shirley
He's going to the faculty party.
	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: britta
To be with professor "short skirt"? We hate her.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: shirley
No, it's not about her, Shirley. I can't believe that Jeff would do this to Annie.
	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: britta
Yes, absolutely. It's about Annie. We should go find that bitch's car and snap off her antenna.
	Speaker: annie	Listeners: self
It's like high school all over again. Everyone's leaving.
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: annie
Not me. I could do this all night. I love you


	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: chang
Please slow down, please
	Speaker: chang	Listeners: jeff
Stop crying, Winger
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: chang
Watch it!


	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: slater
There you go, pretty lady.
	Speaker: slater	Listeners: jeff
What are you doing here?
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: slater
Showing you my non-student side.
	Speaker: slater	Listeners: jeff
I have to admit, this outfit's doing it for me. I may or may not have been deflowered by a junior rodeo champion.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: slater
You're reminding me of my first time too.
	Speaker: slater	Listeners: jeff
You lost your virginity to Robin Hood?
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: slater
No, with an attractive woman at a party. We seem destined to repeat history.
	Speaker: slater	Listeners: jeff
I told you no students. It's unseemly. I go out with you, you tell your friends, it gets around the school...
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: slater
What friends? I have no friends. I hate everyone here but you.


	Speaker: britta	Listeners: jeff
Hey.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: britta
What are you doing here?
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: jeff
What are you doing here? You should be over at the library with Annie... Whoa. Yippy ki yay. Thought you weren't a costume guy.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: britta
You had to have one to get in here, Squirrel.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: jeff
Oh, so where did you get it? 'Cause I wouldn't think that any costume stores would be open this late.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: britta
I don't know what you're getting at.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: jeff
I think the words that you're looking for are "I own a cowboy outfit." And it is tight too. Did you buy it like that? Your toy gun to my head, I'd say yes.
	Speaker: slater	Listeners: britta
Hi. Michelle Slater, PHD.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: slater
Britta Perry, GED.
	Speaker: slater	Listeners: britta
Oh, are you a classmate of Jeff's?
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: slater
Oh, well, when you say "classmate", It sounds like we take naps together and eat paste, but what's great about community colleges is that a lot of the students are just as mature as the teachers.


	Speaker: abed	Listeners: jeff
Jeff, you must return to Annie's party. She's feeling unpopular.
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: jeff
Jeff, Pierce took something, and he is tripping balls. He is touching people and dancing weird. it's like grumpy old men but not hilarious.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: troy abed britta
Okay, uh, guys? I'm at a grownup Halloween party, all right? You're all being unseemly.
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: self
Oh, no.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: jeff
How are we unseemly?
	Speaker: dean	Listeners: all
Why is Urkel ripping the antenna off professor Slater's car?
	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: slater
That's right, professor Slim Calves. This is what you get when you steal Jeff from a good woman!
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: self
No, Abed!
	Speaker: slater	Listeners: all
Is he meowing?
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: slater
Yeah.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: group
Enough. I want you guys out of here.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: britta
Britta, I don't care about your high school soap opera.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: abed
Abed, you're not Batman.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: pierce
Pierce. Pierce. Pierce. Stop grinding on the women's studies department. You are too old to be tripping.
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: jeff
I'm old? What do you mean old? Whose hands are these? Help me!
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: jeff
Way to go. I know I'm not Batman. You could try not being a jerk.
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: jeff
She's pretty hot.


	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: slater
Well, where were we, little doggie?
	Speaker: slater	Listeners: jeff
Unseemly.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: slater
Yeah. Crap.


	Speaker: britta	Listeners: shirley
Shirley? Shirley!
	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: britta
This is professor Robin Hood's office.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: shirley
So what are you doing?
	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: britta
I'm putting this hose in her desk, and you going outside to turn the water on.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: shirley
Why?
	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: britta
To teach that long-neck weave-having bank teller she can't steal another woman's man! That's why. I have a confession to make. I think some of what I just said may have more to do with my situation.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: shirley
Yeah, the long-neck, weave-having bank teller didn't feel universal.
	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: britta
My ex-husband came by this morning, and he, uh, he asked for his ring back. It was his mother's, and he wants to give it to his new girlfriend.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: shirley
Shirley, that sucks.
	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: britta
Don't get me wrong. Best thing ever happened to me was him leaving. I just... I always thought he'd come crawling back, and I'd get to tell him, "go to hell." He couldn't even give me that. You know what the crazy thing is, Britta?
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: shirley
Everything you've done tonight?
	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: britta
It's like I was too proud to admit I was hurt, so I had to pretend that you were.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: shirley
I totally get that.
	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: britta
I feel better now.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: shirley
Let's go check on Annie.
	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: britta
Can you believe I targeted this poor lady? Look at all these awards. I bet she's nice.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: shirley
Yeah.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: self
Nice and pretentious.


	Speaker: annie	Listeners: pierce
Pierce? Pierce, are you okay?
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: pierce
Hey, man, what's going on? You have a full-on erection. Just rela... Just relax.
	Speaker: annie	Listeners: pierce
Pierce, relax. Just relax, okay? Pierce!
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: pierce
You are too old to be tripping!
	Speaker: annie	Listeners: pierce
Pierce...
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: pierce
You are too old to be tripping.
	Speaker: annie	Listeners: pierce
Tell me about the Beatles, Pierce. Tell me about Woodstock and Sputnik, Pierce.
	Speaker: chang	Listeners: jeff
Gee, do I feel a breeze here? Because someone just struck out.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: chang
She blew you off too, Chang.


	Speaker: chang	Listeners: jeff
Is that what you had to fall back on? Look at me, bro. Look at me. I've got the body of a fifth grader, okay? If I was working with what you've got, she'd be at the comfort inn right now giving me a Mexican Halloween.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: chang
It's this campus. It feeds on my coolness. I... I got no moves anymore.
	Speaker: chang	Listeners: jeff
Moves? Everything's a game to guys like you. I know one move I bet you've never tried in your life.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: chang
What is it?


	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: slater
Please sleep with me. Please. Pretty please. I'm so lonely. I haven't slept with anyone in a very long time, and you are so good looking. Please do me the favor of having sex with me.
	Speaker: slater	Listeners: jeff
Okay, stay three steps behind and promise you won't tell anybody.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: slater
I promise. I promise.


	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: all
Everybody, stay out of the library.
	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: pierce
Pierce, it's okay. Come out of there.
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: all
No, I'm not ready to die!
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: pierce
Pierce, you're not gonna die! Look at me!
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: slater
Just... Just keep walking. Don't make eye contact.
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: jeff
Jeff. Jeff! Jeff. Pierce is freaking out. You're the only one that can help.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: troy
What makes you think that?
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: all
Is Jeff out there? He's the only one who can help.
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: jeff
He says he's gonna kill himself, but he doesn't want us to call 911, because he doesn't want to get in trouble for taking drugs.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: self
I can't believe I'm doing this.


	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: slater
I, uh... I think I have to say goodnight.
	Speaker: slater	Listeners: jeff
Are you, like, a court-appointed guardian for these people?
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: slater
Uh, no. Um, they're my classmates.
	Speaker: slater	Listeners: jeff
Goodnight, Jeff.
	Speaker: chang	Listeners: jeff
Loser!


	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: self
What in the Pink Floyd?
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: jeff
I'm gonna crush myself to death with desks and tables, Jeff!
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: pierce
Is that a death befitting a Beastmaster?
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: jeff
I never saw Beastmaster. I just wanted to be cool.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: pierce
I'm coming in there, Pierce.
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: jeff
Those floating Mexican skeletons were right. My life is over.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: pierce
Well, when we go to floating skeletons with our problems, we get what we pay for, don't we?
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: jeff
I'm old, Jeff.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: pierce
Pierce, I don't know how you spent the first 60 years, but I know in the last two months you've probably doubled the national average for amount of life lived per lifetime.
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: jeff
well, I do have a young, African-American friend.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: pierce
Yeah. And, more importantly, you're dressed like a gladiator in a desk fort that you built during a bad trip. If life is just a series of ridiculous attempts to be alive, you're a hero to everything that's ever lived.
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: jeff
Yeah?
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: pierce
Yeah.
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: jeff
Yeah!


	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: abed
Batman?
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: jeff
Yeah?
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: abed
Are you staying for the party?
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: jeff
If I stay, there can be no party.
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: self
I must be out there in the night, staying vigilant. Wherever a party needs to be saved, I'm there. Wherever there are masks, wherever there's tomfoolery and joy, I'm there. But sometimes I'm not, 'cause I'm out in the night, staying vigilant, watching, lurking, running, jumping, hurtling, sleeping... No, I can't sleep. You sleep. I'm awake. I don't sleep. I don't blink. Am I a bird? No. I'm a bat. I am Batman. Or am I? Yes, I am Batman. Happy Halloween.


	Speaker: troy	Listeners: abed
I'm Batman.
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: troy
You sound like cookie monster.
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: abed
I'm Batman.
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: troy
That's Batman.
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: abed
Candy corn looks like tiny traffic cones.
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: troy
Yeah, it sure does.
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: abed
At, like, a candy traffic school. Like, a little gingerbread man at the wheel, and he's drunk.
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: troy
Look out.
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: abed
You'd be driving, But you keep wanting to eat yourself.
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: troy
All day.
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: abed
That's one of my biggest fears.
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: troy
What is?
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: abed
If I ever, like, woke up as a donut.
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: troy
You would eat yourself?
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: abed
I wouldn't even question it.
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: troy
That'd be tasty.
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: abed
It's cool to know other people think about this stuff too.
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: troy
Yeah.




Community - 1x08 - Home Economics.HDTV.LOL.en.srt

	Speaker: chang	Listeners: all
So from now on, we'll refer to each other by our Spanish nombres. It will be...
	Speaker: chang	Listeners: jeff
Buenos dias, Winger.
	Speaker: chang	Listeners: all
Class dismissed.


	Speaker: troy	Listeners: annie
Look, I'm Annie's backpack.
	Speaker: annie	Listeners: troy
Stop it, Troy.
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: annie
Say there are two friends and they're in the same class and one wants to ask the other one out on a date. Like a grown-up date, but within biking distance of his parents' house.
	Speaker: annie	Listeners: troy
They could do something on campus. Tomorrow there's a picnic with live music on the East lawn. They're calling it "A night under the stars".
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: annie
Cool. I bet Randi would love that type of thing.
	Speaker: annie	Listeners: troy
Randi? I thought...
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: annie
You thought... Can't believe I misled you like that. Listen... Randi can be the name of a guy or a girl. And in this case, it is definitely a girl. Thanks for your help.
	Speaker: annie	Listeners: troy
You're welcome. And I hate you. And I want to have your children.


	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: self
Damn, I picked the wrong couple to follow out of class this morning. Jeff and Britta are dead air.


	Speaker: britta	Listeners: jeff
Are you okay? It looks like you have actual bed head this morning.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: britta
In fashion, I'm what's known as a tastemaker.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: jeff
And you missed an entire side of your face shaving.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: britta
And next month, so will Gwen Stefani. Here comes Vaughn. Bye.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: jeff
Crap.
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: britta
Vaughn? The guy with the tiny nipples you did it with.


	Speaker: britta	Listeners: vaughn
Hi, Vaughn. Can we talk sometime? I'm sorry about how things ended.
	Speaker: vaughn	Listeners: britta
I'm sorry I can't accept your apology 'cause you're toxic, Britta. You're like the exact opposite of an antioxidant. I got band practice. Lates.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: vaughn
Can't we still be friends? And isn't the word "later" already short enough?


	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: britta
Let me talk to him for you. Man-to-man is better. We won't think about our chubby thighs or whether or not we can have babies.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: pierce
Don't talk to Vaughn.
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: britta
Your hormones are clouding your...
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: pierce
Don't talk to Vaughn.
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: self
That is "girl" for "talk to Vaughn".
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: britta
Brittles, I forgot to tell you, I went and talked to Vaughn. The bad news is I could not patch up things between you. You really did a number on him. Good news is I'm the new keyboardist in his band.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: pierce
So I asked you not to talk to him and you completely ignored me.
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: britta
You're missing the headline. I'm in a rock band!
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: pierce
I'd like to be there when the band finds out.


	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: britta
You sure you don't want a piece of that?
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: shirley
What is he doing?
	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: britta
I know exactly what he's doing. My ex-husband spent four weeks doing that after his "innocent mistake" of calling me Valerie. That boy's living in his car.
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: group
I lived in my car for a stretch in the '70s. Nothing like bedding a woman on the vinyl backseat of a Skylark. Of course, we didn't have the same safety standards back then so... No condoms. I tell you, before aids, sex was like shaking hands.
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: pierce
Hence aids.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: jeff
Hi Jeff. We were just talking about how in today's economy...
	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: jeff
Living in your car. You are living in your car. I'm sorry, I'm not good at being coy.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: shirley britta
I'm not living in my car. I'm just sleeping in it for a couple of days while I work at some problems with my condo. It's a very temporary issue. I've got to pay some meaningless fees and then they'll put my locks back on the door and that'll be that.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: jeff
How you'll get the money?
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: britta
Believe me, kitten, Winger's got moves.
	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: jeff
Do you need a place to stay?
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: troy
I'd offer but my dad's kind of racist.
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: jeff
Stay with me. My room has a bunk bed, which is a misnomer because it's the real deal.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: group
The next person that offers me charity or pity will be mentioned by name in my suicide note.


	Speaker: troy	Listeners: annie
Annie. Annie. Thanks for your advice about "a night under the stars".
	Speaker: annie	Listeners: troy
Of course. Anytime. Ever.
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: annie
I got to figure out what to bring to the picnic. This is my first college girl so I really want to impress her. Would you mind helping me shop for this stuff?
	Speaker: annie	Listeners: troy
I'd love to.
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: annie
Really? Thanks. Later.


	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: britta
Wanna see my place?
	Speaker: britta	jeff	Listeners: self
I can see it. Two girls are making out on the hood.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: britta
No, my real place. The condo board's trying to bluff me by listing my place as available. Look at those faucets. Handcrafted in Italy. 100% expensive.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: jeff
Those faucets are beautiful. You know what they would go great with: a home, which you no longer have. You need to move on with your life.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: britta
Yeah. Move on with my life. "Shmove shmon shmith shmy shmife. " This condo is all that's left of me. Every part of it is a part of who I am.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: jeff
Is that a bidet?
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: britta
That part's for resale value. And Saturday afternoons.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: jeff
You know, downgrading your lifestyle is your chance to grow as a person. Maybe even become one. The less you have, the more you can be. You know what I'm saying?
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: britta
There's a silver lining here, isn't there? You're attracted to bums.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: jeff
Good night.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: britta
Come on. Why don't you have dinner at my place? I got a hot plate that plugs into a cigarette lighter.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: jeff
Yeah, but your kitchen's being towed.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: britta
Stop! That's my house!


	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: abed
Can I live with you?
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: jeff
Yeah. Cool. You want the top or the bottom bunk?
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: abed
Top.
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: jeff
Me too. Race you for it I win.


	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: extra
Look, I really need to liquidate some assets. It's an emergency situation. What kind of an offer is that? These are mint condition issues. The premise alone is priceless. The guy has the powers and strength of a spider. No, your incredulity perplexes me, nerd.


	Speaker: abed	Listeners: jeff
Jeff, did I say anything in my sleep about farm animals or Brian Williams?
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: abed
I don't think so.
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: jeff
Cool. Cool cool cool. Lucky charms?
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: abed
How are you so satisfied all the time? Don't you ever want anything more out of life than cereal?
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: jeff
Sometimes I like to pour hot cocoa mix into cold milk and drink like it like a cold hot chocolate. I call it "special drink".
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: abed
And some day you will know it by its true name, "diabetes. "
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: jeff
You're Goldie Hawn, Jeff.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: abed
I'm sorry?
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: jeff
You're Goldie Hawn.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: abed
Is it the lips?
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: jeff
No. In overboard, she was just like you. Wealthy, assertive, arrogant. Got manicures all the time. But she fell off her boat, good thing for her because, she realized she was happier being poor and rising four boys with Kurt Russell.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: abed
Can I not be Kurt Russell?
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: jeff
Do whatever you want. You just have to know what that is. For me, it's Lucky Charms... and tv.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: abed
I could use a break.


	Speaker: troy	Listeners: annie
A picnic blanket. Genius. I was gonna lay down on newspaper.
	Speaker: annie	Listeners: troy
It's the blanket my grandmother used to court my grandfather.
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: annie
Yeah? That's pretty hot. Thanks.


	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: annie
Tell that boy how you feel!
	Speaker: annie	Listeners: shirley
It's scary. If he's not interested, I could lose the friendship too.
	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: annie
You could. Love is a gamble always. But waiting won't change the dice. You either roll them or lose your turn.
	Speaker: annie	Listeners: shirley
I'm going to roll them. I am. I just... I need a few more shakes.
	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: annie
Shake 'em in your mind, okay? Excuse me, Pierce's band is playing and I want to record the train wreck. Kind of hoping for a Michael Richards situation.


	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: britta
Oh! They're pretty good. This isn't weird for you?
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: shirley
No. Just want to show Vaughn some support to help smooth things over.


	Speaker: vaughn	Listeners: all
Saying good-bye to Britta was the hardest thing to do. But when someone's a bitch and a liar, there ain't nothing left to woo. I'm getting rid of Britta. What am I doing?	 I'm getting rid of the b.
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: all
She's a no-good b.
	Speaker: vaughn	Listeners: all
I'm getting rid of Britta, I'm getting rid of the b.
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: all
She's a gdb.


	Speaker: abed	Listeners: jeff
Really great to have somebody to watch stuff with. My dad never wanted to watch anything so I was kind of raised by tv.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: abed
Tv's the best dad there is. Tv never came home drunk. Tv never forgot me at the zoo. Tv never abused and insulted me, unless you count Cop Rock.
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: jeff
Cop Rock. That sounds cool.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: abed
Doesn't it?


	Speaker: britta	Listeners: jeff
Wow, you guys are really dorming it up in here, huh?
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: britta
In the last two days, I spent a quarter.
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: britta
We're having the time of our lives.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: jeff
See? Who needs platinum faucets? Do you guys even have faucets in here?
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: britta
There's a communal bathroom down the hallway. It actually helped me come to terms with losing my condo. You don't sit on a toilet like that until you've left the material world.
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: pavel
Pavel!
	Speaker: pavel	Listeners: jeff abed
Hey, bros.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: britta
This is Pavel. He lives next door. He's from Poland.
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: pavel
Britta
	Speaker: pavel	Listeners: jeff abed
Britta! I'm getting rid of Britta, getting rid of the b.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: jeff abed
Excuse me, I have a future murder victim to visit.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: abed
Cool.
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: jeff
Cool.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: abed
Cool cool cool.


	Speaker: britta	Listeners: vaughn pierce
Guys, what the hell! "Getting rid of Britta"? That song was disrespectful to me and to the definition of "rhyme scheme".
	Speaker: vaughn	Listeners: britta
If you don't like my song, you don't have to listen, all right? I'm an artist and I write what I feel. And I feel that you suck.
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: vaughn
All right, hold on here. Can I have a word with you? Could you come here, please, for a second? What'd you say?
	Speaker: vaughn	Listeners: pierce
I know Britta's your friend, but my song is more important.
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: vaughn
Your song. We wrote it together. Are you trying to Garfunkel me?
	Speaker: vaughn	Listeners: pierce
Maybe. Assuming to "Garfunkel" someone is to keep putting up with them even though they're a fat, lazy cat who hogs the spotlight and eats lasagna.
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: vaughn
I get it. You're jealous.
	Speaker: vaughn	Listeners: pierce
What? Why?
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: vaughn
I don't know. Because when I were these skinny jeans, my ass looks like a baby pumpkin. Or because I'm not a small-nippled, credit-hogging jag who only knows three power cords.
	Speaker: vaughn	Listeners: pierce
My band, my song! You want that? How you like that?
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: vaughn
You get on that horse.


	Speaker: britta	Listeners: pierce
Did you just defend my honor?
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: britta
Oh, yeah, totally.


	Speaker: annie	Listeners: troy
And you'll light the candles. And you'll take a bite. And she'll take a bite. And you'll laugh. And you'll offer her your letter jacket after you notice this funny way she shakes when she gets cold. And she'll feel like the luckiest girl in the world.
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: annie
Right. I couldn't have done this without your help. You're really nice. We should've hung out more in high school.
	Speaker: annie	Listeners: troy
Remember when you pretended to be my backpack?
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: annie
Oh ho, yeah. yeah.I'm funny. All right. I got to go get ready.
	Speaker: annie	Listeners: troy
Troy, wait! I have to tell you... My appendix is bursting.
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: annie
What?
	Speaker: annie	Listeners: troy
My appendix is bursting.


	Speaker: nurse	Listeners: troy annie
Okay. Two young students. Think I've been to this dance before. You guys are sexual partners, right?
	Speaker: annie	Listeners: nurse
Us? No. He's my very good friend. And I have appendicitis.
	Speaker: annie	Listeners: troy
Thanks for bringing me here. Guess I ruined your date, huh?
	Speaker: nurse	Listeners: annie
Doesn't seem to be anything wrong with you.
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: annie
Cool. I'll see you.
	Speaker: nurse	Listeners: annie
Where does it hurt?
	Speaker: annie	Listeners: nurse
Everywhere.
	Speaker: nurse	Listeners: annie
Okay, we have to quarantine you. We got to get you to a safe distance.
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: nurse
My date's on the east lawn.
	Speaker: nurse	Listeners: troy
East lawn. Perfect. This a date? You'll need these.
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: annie
Nice. I'll be thinking of you.
	Speaker: annie	Listeners: troy
Okay, I need to go.
	Speaker: nurse	Listeners: annie
No, we... We have to observe you overnight. It's policy. We don't want another "Vanessa Parsons" on our hand. She was the "typhoid mary" of herpes. I'm kind of the hawkeye around here so it's kind of a... Are you seeing anybody?


	Speaker: britta	Listeners: abed jeff
You guys weren't in spanish class.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: britta
Knight Rider marathon.
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: britta
Shadowy flight into the world of a man who does not exist. Britta, may I have a word?
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: extra
Has this always been here?
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: abed
No.


	Speaker: abed	Listeners: britta
You need to take Jeff back.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: abed
Never had him. Don't want him. Especially now. He's got a real Phil Spector vibe going.
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: britta
He's like E.T. He crashed in my place. And we're friends now, it's great for me, but it's bad for him. He needs to get back.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: abed
What am I supposed to do about that?
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: britta
Use your lady parts.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: abed
Abed!
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: britta
Don't be naive. The charge between you was keeping him going. Tell him you'll make love to him if he takes a shower and finds a nice place to live.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: abed
I'm heading back. Pavel's making babka.
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: britta
Do it. Seduce him. Draw the tapeworm of Jeff out of him with your sexuality.
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: britta
Then say good-bye to E.T.


	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: abed
Abed, it's open!
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: britta
What are you doing? That was the Jeffersons, honky.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: jeff
I was wrong, okay? Material possessions are important. Think how much happier the Jeffersons were than that family on good times.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: britta
But they had good times.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: jeff
Well, do good times really matter? What about good cars, good lobster? What about that... That sport where the British people ride the horses with the really long hammers?
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: britta
Jeez, you are way out of your element here.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: jeff
Yes, and I do not believe a single word I am saying for me. But for you, maybe you're one of those rare people with nothing underneath the surface. Maybe if you put stain remover on a turd, you don't get a diamond. You just get a turd with less direction in life.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: britta
Thanks, coach. Can you turn the tv back on?
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: jeff
Faucets.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: britta
Italian faucets, handcrafted. These look like... Wait... I made this notch to indicate optimal cleansing temperature for combination skin. These were mine?
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: jeff
For a fancy condo, you've got awful security. Install those in a new apartment so that every day, when you're spending way too much time on your hair, you can look down and think, "I was a huge phony before. I can do it again!"
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: britta
You're into me.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: jeff
I beg your unbelievable pardon.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: britta
Look at all this work you're doing just to have me around again. You were may more attracted to me than you were willing to admit.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: jeff
I was doing this all for Abed. You are the worst.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: britta
Yeah. Clearly.


	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: vaughn
Vaughn, I just want you to know, I haven't changed my mind. I am out. Also, do me a favor, will you lay off Britta? She may walk like she just got off a horse, but underneath all that clown makeup, she's a good kid.
	Speaker: vaughn	Listeners: pierce
No worries, man. I've moved on. Lates!
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: vaughn
Lates. Okay. Snakes. What?
	Speaker: vaughn	Listeners: all
Pierce, I don't need you in my band. I don't need your heart or your hand. I am my own person, and, Pierce, you're a b. Yeah, you heard me say it. Pierce, you're a b.


	Speaker: annie	Listeners: troy brandi
No! Before you two proceed, I have one thing to say...
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: annie
Did you... say it already?
	Speaker: annie	Listeners: troy brandi
I want nana's blanket back. Do you guys mind? Could you scoot over? It's an heirloom. I want it back. Thank you. Have a nice date.


	Speaker: annie	Listeners: shirley
I don't care what you think. For me, that was huge.
	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: annie
I know, sweetie. Let's go find you some pants.


	Speaker: rapper	Listeners: all
This song's for Pierce 'cause he's so old His body made of wrinkles and folds. Stupid and ugly, he smell like a fart, the poo-poo in his pants and poo-poo in my heart.


	Speaker: britta	Listeners: jeff
Hey, look who the cat dragged out and licked clean.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: britta
I saw how much you missed me, and smelled what happens to Pavel on cabbage night, and realized the world was better off with me in it. Thanks... For, uh... Caring.


	Speaker: abed	Listeners: jeff
You look like you moved out.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: abed
I checked into a motel and I'm looking for apartments. You would've been fine with me staying there forever?
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: jeff
Yep.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: abed
You're pretty cool, Abed.
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: jeff
You're a huge nerd.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: abed
Thanks.


	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: all
I'm Pierce. Yeah. Song's about me.


	Speaker: rapper	Listeners: pierce
East side, west side, North side, south Vaughn's breath is so bad, His butts mad at his mouth This rap is by Pierce, Vaughn is dumb He wears diapers to bed, And sucks his mothers thumb And when he wakes up, Stupid wishing he was me He has a big poop breakfast, With a glass of pee Then he goes to school, Where he's stupid again And everybody hates him, Even all his friends When you come after Pierce, Then the battle is on So this rap goes out, To stupid Vaughn
	Speaker: vaughn	Listeners: pierce
Well payed Pierce. This isn't over.

old trick for achieving the proper competitive mindset, I always envision my opponent having aggressive sex With my mother.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: debate
This feels so formal. Let's just talk. People are evil. They can't help it.

	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: debate
man is evil.
	Speaker: jean	Listeners: jeff

	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: jean
for my own selfish purposes. The fact is, as hot as you look, And it is quite hot, I wouldn't have said anything.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: debate
When i talk about people being evil, I could cite quotes or dig up statistics, But those are just words and numbers. I think we could have a little more fun If i express myself in song. * evil woman * * ba na na na na * * evil woman * I knew you could do it. That's my time, everybody. Thank you very much. Yeah!
	Speaker: jean	Listeners: debate

	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: abed

	Speaker: abed	Listeners: shirley
shirley, i have no psychic abilities. I'm just an entertainer. But if it'll make you feel any better, Here, let me show you what i'm working on.
	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: abed
i'm sorry. is that me being chased down by a werewolf?
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: shirley
yeah. and that's how you'd behave in that situation, no?
	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: abed
the situation being me being chased down by a werewolf.
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: shirley
mm-hmm.
	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: abed
and that's jeff locking lips with annie.
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: shirley
mm-hmm. yeah.
	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: abed
you're a fool.


	Speaker: annie	Listeners: jeff
so, in the experiment, stanford students were divided Into prisoners and guards. The guards immediately started--
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: annie
uh!
	Speaker: annie	Listeners: jeff
what's wrong?
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: annie
i have this weird pain right above my eyebrow.
	Speaker: annie	Listeners: jeff
it's called a stress headache. I got my first one when i was four.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: annie
i hate it.
	Speaker: annie	Listeners: jeff
well, get used to it. You're knee-deep in it now, brother. This is debate. If you want to win, You need to prepare.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: annie
well, agreed, but if you want to win, You need to loosen up. Go off book, robot debater.
	Speaker: annie	Listeners: jeff
oh, my gosh. You're right. Simmons is so good at using his inherent magnetism To sell his points, and here i am, Like a spinster librarian with my hair pulled back.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: annie

	Speaker: annie	Listeners: jeff
totally. We should get back to work.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: annie
yes. um, okay. The people are inherently evil.
	Speaker: annie	Listeners: jeff
ooh, we can use this hobbes quote. "man is a collection "of base animal urges. "to act on them and experience "sinful pleasure would be morally no different Than taking a breath." That's poignant, right?
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: annie
yeah. You know, maybe we should study alone.
	Speaker: annie	Listeners: jeff
yeah.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: annie
separately.
	Speaker: annie	Listeners: jeff
uh-huh. That way we can be more reproductive--productive!

Bye! oh, you forgot your phone.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: annie
well, i can get another one.


	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: britta
the next time you even see a cigarette, You will think of things that disgust you. And while you're under so deep, You'll find yourself attracted To slightly older men. Perhaps, some barrel-chested stud With just enough tummy to love. You'll want to buy him dinner, Then go back to his hot tub. Perhaps, you'll invite one of your friends To join us for a three-way. Maybe someone with low self-esteem And slightly larger breasts.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: pierce
go to hell, you disgusting pig.
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: britta
a-ha!
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: pierce

	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: britta
i know. I saw you. What do you think i am, some kind of a joke?
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: pierce
no. No, i was trying to make you Feel better about yourself.
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: britta
how dare you pity me? I may be a little older, My ideas may seem weird, And my fashion sense may cause envy. But i have a lot to offer. And i will not be pitied. Do not help me up.


	Speaker: simmons	Listeners: debate
and as german poet franz wickmeyer once wrote... "snow falls from the heavens pure. "we cannot blame the snow for being... Soiled by the earth." Man is good.
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: abed

	Speaker: simmons	Listeners: jeff

	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: debate
in the stanford prison experiment, 21 out of 21 students, when given absolute power, Abused and tortured their fellow students. My competitor likens people to pure, falling snow. I would respond, "there is none righteous. No, not one." Now i realize mr. simmons' quote Was from the great franz wickmeyer. Mine was just from a simple desert handyman Named jesus.

	Speaker: britta	Listeners: group
there's only one solution. Someone has to go to chang and talk to him.

pepe, usted es viejo. "you are old."
	Speaker: chang	Listeners: abed
alberto, usted es feo. "you are ugly."
	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: abed

	Speaker: troy	Listeners: jeff

	Speaker: britta	Listeners: jeff
we're all very disappointed.
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: britta
all right, dial it back a little, britta.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: group
if anyone should be disappointed, it's me. What kind of a group threatens to kick someone out Unless he helps them?
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: jeff
what kind of a person is asked to help other people And then helps himself!
	Speaker: annie	Listeners: self
yeah.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: self
mm-hmm.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: group
helps himself? I don't think i like being talked to that way!
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: group
he's using fake outrage to justify leaving.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: britta
fake outrage? justify my-- Yeah, that's it. i'm out of here.
	Speaker: annie	Listeners: jeff
oh, you're breaking up with the group?
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: group

	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: chang
i can see that you're hurting. Um, but i have to get to accounting. And it's not like i'm hitting strip clubs With professor whitman.
	Speaker: chang	Listeners: jeff

	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: chang

	Speaker: chang	Listeners: jeff
all i ask Is for you to keep filling the void in my soul.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: chang
well, i'll have to think of something. Let me rest gently on your pecs.


	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: shirley
best closer to a presentation, a nicholson quote. Uh, you take a phrase from one of his films And you tailor it to your product. You can't handle a moist towelette! Something like that, you know? But you can't use that one. that's--that's mine.

i'll take the northeast. Northeast is closest to the drinking fountain--
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: abed troy
all right, guys, are we gonna do this thing?
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: pierce
pierce. I hope that's the tiny gun That you throw at us to confuse us While you grab the giant gun That's duct-taped to your back.
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: pierce
seriously, this hardly seems like a fair fight.

	Speaker: annie	Listeners: dean
So I booked a sketch artist, an improve troupe, and there'll be a laser projecting a burning pelvis onto the ceiling.
	Speaker: dean	Listeners: annie
A laser! Well, this isn't gonna be your mother's sexually transmitted disease awareness fair. You've been quite the little helper, Annie.
	Speaker: annie	Listeners: troy abed
Oh, STD fair, guys. Catch knowledge.


	Speaker: troy	Listeners: abed
You think you're better than me?
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: troy
No.
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: abed
You stick to quotin' movie lines. I'll stick to sports.
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: troy
I'm trying to reduce my pop-cultural referencing.
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: abed
Well, you're not moving into sports. You and I are playing real basketball, right now.
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: troy
Sounds fun.
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: abed
No, it doesn't! And it won't be.


	Speaker: annie	Listeners: jeff britta
Catch knowledge.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: annie
Sorry, not interested...
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: secretary
in ignoring your very important cause. Hi, I'm Jeff Winger.
	Speaker: dean	Listeners: jeff
Oh, Sabrina is my new secretary.
	Speaker: secretary	Listeners: dean
"Secretary" is a little degrading to women.
	Speaker: secretary	Listeners: jeff
I help the dean do officey things.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: secretary
Oh, gender saved.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: secretary
My casual friend and I are gonna have a non-romantic breakfast if you'd like to join us.
	Speaker: annie	Listeners: jeff
The cafeteria's closed while we set up for the fair. Fortune cookie?
	Speaker: dean	Listeners: jeff britta
Isn't it great? Greendale is the latest campus to catch a case of public health fever!
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: dean
You know the toilets in the women's bathrooms don't have seats, right?
	Speaker: dean	Listeners: britta
Because they keep getting stolen.
	Speaker: dean	Listeners: secretary
Sabrina, take a note. I want hidden cameras in every stall.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: annie jeff
Problem solved.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: self
"You will get aids."
	Speaker: annie	Listeners: jeff
Flip it over.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: self
"Unless you go to the STD fair."
	Speaker: annie	Listeners: jeff
I wrote that.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: annie
Congratu... horrible!
	Speaker: annie	Listeners: jeff
See you later.


	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: jeff
Jeff... you and I are friends, right?
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: pierce
Okay.
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: jeff
You may have noticed a recent change in my demeanor.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: pierce
I haven't.
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: jeff
Well, I have a new girlfriend. And she is super smart, if you know what I mean.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: pierce
Unfortunately, I always know what you mean.
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: jeff
Can't wait for you to meet her. You know, when you catch a big fish, you want to stuff her and put her on the mantle. How 'bout tonight?
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: pierce
I doubt it.


	Speaker: abed	Listeners: jeff pierce
Troy and I played basketball. It was fun.
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: abed
Don't gloat. It's impossible to guard you. Your eyes are too gentle and mysterious.


	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: group
Hey, guys, Jeff and I are double-dating tonight with my new girlfriend.
	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: pierce
Ooh...
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: pierce
You got that from "I doubt it"?
	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: pierce
Pierce has got a girlfriend!
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: pierce
That's great. What does she do?
	Speaker: 	pierce	Listeners: group
She's an escort.
	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: pierce
Oh...
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: group
Some mysteries solve themselves, don't they?
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: group
No, no, no, that's just her profession. She doesn't escort me. No, no. I met her in my marketing class. And I'm taking Doreen to Annie's mixer tonight.
	Speaker: annie	Listeners: pierce
You mean the STD fair. Catch knowledge.
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: self
Taking a call girl to an STD fair. There's a joke here.
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: jeff
So, Jeff, dust off that black book and rustle up a honey, huh?
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: pierce
Is there a pill that makes the word "no" clearer?
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: jeff
Well, I guess it is pretty short notice. Probably couldn't get a date anyway.
	Speaker: group	Listeners: self
Oooohh...
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: pierce
I'm sure you're right.
	Speaker: group	Listeners: self
Oooohh...
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: self
Maybe it has something to do with crabs. They're like a food, but they're also a disease.
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: jeff
You know, I wonder, Jeffrey, for all your feather flashing, when was the last time you actually scored?
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: pierce
Well, I don't know the precise date, Pierce, because I'm not you, so there's no receipt.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: group
Ooohh...
	Speaker: group	Listeners: jeff
Meh...
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: group
Oh, come on.
	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: jeff
Jeff, you shouldn't take potshots at some poor woman just because you can't get a date.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: shirley
I can get dates anytime I want.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: group
What is this, some kind of joke?
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: group
No. This is. "Don't eat the crab dip." Yay-yay!


	Speaker: dean	Listeners: annie
Ah... You hear that, Annie? That's the sound of STDs screaming, "No! Stop being so aware of us!" Aah! And it's all thanks to you.
	Speaker: annie	Listeners: dean
I was voted most likely to succeed at my rehab clinic.
	Speaker: dean	Listeners: annie
Well, in recognition of all your hard work, I have decided that you should conduct the condom demonstration. You're gonna be center stage showing everyone how to put a condom on a, well, what my dad called a Jimmy Carter.
	Speaker: annie	Listeners: dean
Um, I don't know if I'm the right person for that.
	Speaker: dean	Listeners: annie
Don't worry, not a real one. No, it's an anatomically correct model, you know. But trust me, eyes closed, you can't tell the difference. Okay.


	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: extra
Hey, it's Jeff Winger. Well, I wanted to see what you were doing tonight. What do you mean, do I know your name? What kind of a question is that? Of course I know. Well, if I answer now, you'll never learn a valuable lesson about trust, Jennifer.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: self
Crap! Ahh...


	Speaker: britta	Listeners: jeff
Pierce really got to you, huh?
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: britta
It has been a dry spell. But that's only because it's been a while since I've tried. So I'm trying.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: britta
Yeah, I can see that. This is a lot of outgoing calls. "Car wash redhead. Tube top, REM Concert." "Juror number six." That sounds aboveboard. At least you have "mommy" in here. It's not my mom.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: jeff
Dude, not cool.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: britta
You saying "dude" is not cool. What are you doing?
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: jeff
Heh! "Hot blonde, Spanish class"?
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: britta
You're welcome.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: jeff
This is the phone book of a man in his 20s. The women literally have no identities. It's pretty shallow.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: britta
You're right. I can't believe I haven't seen it before now.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: jeff
Whatever. I'm gonna go study with Shirley.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: britta
Well, I'll be here... Rethinking my way of life.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: jeff
Mm.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: britta
Call mommy.


	Speaker: annie	Listeners: britta shirley
Guys... I have a problem. The dean wants me to demonstrate the proper use of a condom at the stupid fair by putting one on a mannequin's stupid... Thingamabob. It's a big honor... But I'm gonna screw it up.
	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: annie
Well, it's easy enough to practice.
	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: britta
Britta, do you have a banana?
	Speaker: annie	Listeners: britta shirley
This is an anatomically correct model I'll be handling. Real... whatchamacallits... are nothing like bananas! Are they?
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: annie
Have you never seen one?
	Speaker: annie	Listeners: britta
Shh!
	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: annie
Annie... being a virgin in this day and age is something to be proud of. You're like a unicorn.
	Speaker: annie	Listeners: shirley britta
I am not a unicorn. I had relations with my high school boyfriend. We did it to Madonna's erotica on the floor of his walk-in closet. But he wouldn't let me look at it. And he cried after. And during. He's gay now.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: annie
I think he was gay then.
	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: annie
So you, uh, you never seen one when you were growing up? Like, you know, on the Internet, in a picture, or Harvey Keitel's?
	Speaker: annie	Listeners: shirley britta
I've caught glimpses, but I've never got a real good look at one. What I need to do is practice on the actual model, but the dean has it locked in his office.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: annie
Okay, that's easy enough. We'll go to him and we'll ask him...
	Speaker: annie	Listeners: britta shirley
No! This is really embarrassing. I don't want anyone to know. I just want to figure out how to do it and get it over with. The dean is counting on me, and I want him to know that I'm someone he can trust. We have to break into his office.
	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: britta annie
I actually have no problem with that.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: annie
I think I could do that. Mm-hmm.


	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: jeff
Oh, hello, Jeffrey.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: pierce
Hi, Pierce.
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: jeff
I was just going into the fair to wait for my smokin'-hot date.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: pierce
That's nice.
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: jeff
How 'bout you? Were you ever able to, you know, come up with a, you know, date?
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: pierce
No, no. Because I didn't try. Because taking a date to an STD fair would be lame.
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: jeff
Don't worry about it, kid. What you're going through is a dry spell. From my experience, they don't last any more than 12, 13 years.
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: jeff
Excuse me.


	Speaker: dean	Listeners: extra
Step right up. Get a prize, not an STD. Oh, no, syphilis. Please, please, no, syphilis. Ow, it burns! Oh, that's gonna hurt.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: dean
Gross. Dean, your assistant. Is she single? What are her likes and dislikes?
	Speaker: dean	Listeners: jeff
Uh, yes on single. She likes hip-hop and horses. Dislikes beards and... yeah, I was done talking.


	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: secretary
Is it me, or are horses the most beautiful creatures? They're so majestic.
	Speaker: secretary	Listeners: jeff
Totally.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: secretary
I mean, just this morning when I was shaving and listening to the new Jay-Z, I was thinking about how I want to squeeze in a quick gallop this weekend.
	Speaker: secretary	Listeners: jeff
Do you own a horse?
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: secretary
Can you ever really own a horse?


	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: pierce
Pierce.
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: jeff
Yeah.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: pierce
This is Sabrina. About 30 seconds after you walked away, I asked her to be my date for the fair, and she said yes.
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: jeff
Oh, you must have a great personality.
	Speaker: secretary	Listeners: pierce
Thank you.
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: jeff
Congratulations, Jeff. You proved me wrong. You got a girl.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: pierce
Yeah, I did.
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: jeff
Oh, this is Doreen. Ready for our double date?
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: pierce
Yes, I am. Wait, how'd you do that?


	Speaker: dean	Listeners: chang
Is this the best safe sex fair or what? Check out these condoms. All along the side it says "Greendale"! Exclamation point, my idea.


	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: pierce
Wow, me in a dune buggy. With syphilis. This is going on the fridge.
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: jeff
Hey, look how gorgeous Doreen is tonight. Hey, can we... Let's lay out our plans for the evening. You wing man me, I wing man you. Maybe we split up for a little hoo-ha. And then meet in the morning for eggs and... details.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: pierce
That sounds like the worst combination plate ever.


	Speaker: troy	Listeners: abed
Ugh! I can't believe you beat me again!
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: troy
You want my stuffed animal?
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: abed
Aah! We're arm wrestling. Ugh!
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: troy
Oh, like Stallone in over the top. But I'm not sure of all the rules. Don't I need a semi truck and a ten-year-old son?
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: abed
The rules are you suck! Let's go!
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: troy
Uh, I want to wait for a more inspiring song. This score isn't right. There we go.
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: abed
Aah! You broke my hand, you bastard.


	Speaker: britta	Listeners: shirley
I can't do anything with this.
	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: britta annie
Hmm, let me see that. Ooh, I can see through the door. Oh, yeah. Thar she blows.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: shirley
Ooh, I wanna see! I wanna see!
	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: britta
Okay, go, go, go.
	Speaker: annie	Listeners: britta
Shh.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: self
Oh!
	Speaker: annie	Listeners: britta shirley
I'm the one that needs to see.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: annie
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.
	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: annie
It's okay.
	Speaker: annie	Listeners: britta shirley
Oh, boy. Oh, I had it wroooong! Is that considered large?
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: annie
Yes.
	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: annie
No.
	Speaker: security	Listeners: annie britta shirley
What in the reverse porky's is going on here?


	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: jeff
You know, Doreen speaks six languages. You should hear her order wine in French.
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: doreen
Hey, honey, say caber-net sauv-a-gong-da-nun.
	Speaker: doreen	Listeners: pierce
Pierce, you're embarrassing me.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: doreen
Do you know a lot about wine?
	Speaker: doreen	Listeners: jeff
Well, I did have a client who owned a vineyard in Napa. He was into S&M and Merlot, so we called it S&M&M.
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: doreen
Honey, you're boring the crap out of Jeff.
	Speaker: secretary	Listeners: jeff
Be right back. I have to make tinkles.
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: jeff doreen
Well, then, I'm gonna go get us another round.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: doreen
You know, you are not what I expected. You're smart, you're classy. You're not wearing go-go boots.
	Speaker: doreen	Listeners: jeff
They're in the shop. You know, despite what most people think, I actually spend most of my time talking. As men get older, they want to spend their time with someone they can have a real conversation with.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: doreen
That is going to suck.
	Speaker: doreen	Listeners: jeff
"Going to", Jeff? Look, Sabrina's cute, but she thinks that Monty Python is the evil snake from Harry Potter.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: doreen
Trust me, I know girls I can converse with who are way more annoying. I will take "tinkles" over "we need to talk" every time.


	Speaker: secretary	Listeners: jeff
Hey, babe. Ready to show me that Lexus?
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: secretary
I thought you'd never ask.


	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: doreen
Doreen... it was very nice to meet you.
	Speaker: doreen	Listeners: jeff
You can do better.


	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: doreen
Here. Rrrrr... Oh, they already left? What a couple of nincompoops! Uh, before I buy dinner, I have to ask... is there any lovemaking on the table?
	Speaker: doreen	Listeners: pierce
We're through, Pierce. I'm gonna go to the bar, and you can join me if you'd like. And we can still have a lovely evening. But it will cost you 200 bucks.


	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: extra
That is a pretty big discount.


	Speaker: dean	Listeners: self
I had no idea alcohol would make people horny. Makes me sleepy. I don't...
	Speaker: security	Listeners: dean
Dean.
	Speaker: dean	Listeners: security
Yeah.
	Speaker: security	Listeners: dean
We have a 597 currently going on in your office.
	Speaker: dean	Listeners: security
A 597? There's a dog-fighting ring in my office?


	Speaker: dean	Listeners: annie britta shirley
Okay, I'm just gonna turn him around, and we're gonna cover him up. Okay, ladies, I am shocked at the reverse porky's that has happened here tonight.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: dean
I don't see what the big deal is. Annie just needed to look at the model of the pe...
	Speaker: dean	Listeners: all
Oh, okay, the "p" word has entered into play. That's exactly why I wanted Gail, our school counselor, here, and Monique, who's keeping record, to ensure we discuss these sensitive topics in a legally appropriate manner.
	Speaker: gail	Listeners: all
I think everyone should say penis so we can take away the negative power of the word. Yeah? So, everybody...
	Speaker: all	Listeners: self
Penis.
	Speaker: security	Listeners: all
She didn't say it.
	Speaker: dean	Listeners: britta shirley annie
Now, why did you break in to see the penis?
	Speaker: dean	Listeners: gail
Wow, I really do feel more comfortable saying that now, Gail.
	Speaker: gail	Listeners: all
I just want to focus on the girl who won't say penis.
	Speaker: gail	Listeners: annie
This is a judgment-free zone, so express yourself.
	Speaker: annie	Listeners: all
You know what? I don't want to express myself. I don't want to sit in a room full of people and say the "p" word. I like being repressed. I am totally comfortable being uncomfortable with my sexuality. And maybe, just maybe, if everyone were a little bit more like me, we wouldn't have to have an STD fair.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: annie
You go, girl!
	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: annie
That's my pumpkin!
	Speaker: annie	Listeners: all
By the way, now that I've gotten a good look at one, I don't see what all the fuss was about. A giant thumb in a turtleneck. Whoop-dee-do!


	Speaker: secretary	Listeners: jeff
You have a really awesome body. You probably hear that all the time.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: secretary
Not as much as I should.
	Speaker: secretary	Listeners: jeff
Oh... professor...
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: secretary
What? I'm not a professor.
	Speaker: secretary	Listeners: jeff
But you're at Greendale... And you're old.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: secretary
I'm a student.
	Speaker: secretary	Listeners: jeff
Yikers.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: secretary
Yeah, it's pretty much Yikers for me too.
	Speaker: secretary	Listeners: jeff
Well, I guess I can make an exception... professor.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: secretary
Mmm... You know, uh...
	Speaker: secretary	Listeners: jeff
Huh?
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: secretary
I can't do this.
	Speaker: secretary	Listeners: jeff
What? But this is your car.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: secretary
Keep it.
	Speaker: secretary	Listeners: jeff
But...


	Speaker: troy	Listeners: abed
Yeah! Yes! Yes! How you like those apples?
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: troy
I don't like those apples. I'm so upset. It was just a fluke I won those other games.
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: self
Troy!


	Speaker: chang	Listeners: dean
Wow, this may be the only STD fair to actually spread STDs.
	Speaker: dean	Listeners: chang
Shut up, Ben!
	Speaker: chang	Listeners: dean
Oh, my God. That's why you don't print things on condoms. Everyone's getting preggers, and it's all your fault. Oh, God, I love it.
	Speaker: dean	Listeners: self
Oh, man!


	Speaker: extra	Listeners: all
Condom water balloon fight! What the hell? Dude, these are leaking.


	Speaker: dean	Listeners: troy
Troy! Troy, all the condoms are faulty. As the best athlete on campus, I need you to run to my office and make an announcement before everyone leaves.
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: dean
Dean, I am not the best athlete on campus. Abed is.
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: abed
I know you let me win the race.
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: troy
But you didn't say anything.
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: abed
That's because... I wanted it to be true.
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: troy
You're a really good friend.
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: abed
No, Abed... You are.
	Speaker: dean	Listeners: abed
For the love of God, run!
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: troy dean
Okay.
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: abed
Go, Abed, go, before people sex one another!


	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: jeff
There he is. Back already. Detail time?
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: pierce
I stopped. I don't know what's wrong with me. I mean, she's hot. I think this place is sapping my life force.
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: jeff
Oh, it's not Greendale, Jeff, it's you. You're becoming more mature. I mean, a man reaches a point in his life where he stops looking for a place to hang his underwear and starts looking for a place to hang his hat.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: pierce
Oh, I'm sorry, I was waiting for that to become inappropriate or racist. What happened to Doreen?
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: jeff
Oh, uh, she said if I wanted to continue the night I'd have to pay.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: pierce
Oh, man, that... that is rough.
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: jeff
Oh, no, it was a wake-up call. Doreen's a very special lady. I did not treat her right. I have stuff to work on, you know?
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: pierce
You'll get there.
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: jeff
We're both gonna get there. Here's to being better men.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: pierce
Cheers.
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: jeff
So could I borrow 200 bucks?
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: pierce
Tell Doreen I say hi.
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: jeff
You know, for 220 I can get the...
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: pierce
I'll give you 250 if you don't finish telling me.
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: jeff
Ooh, I can get it twice. Ah, college. Best years of our lives.


	Speaker: abed	Listeners: all
Attention, Greendale students. Don't use the condoms! If you're going to have sex tonight, don't use condoms.


	Speaker: abed	Listeners: troy
The characteristic of an acid to donate or accept a proton cannot be quantified for individual species, comparing two donor acceptor systems, the proton transposition H8 plus H20...

Yeah Troy?
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: abed
Can you give me a glass of water?
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: troy
Sure.

	Speaker: dean	Listeners: all
Happy last day before winter break, Greendale! Time to visit our loved ones. Some of you will travel as far as three Miles! Don't forget to visit our winter wonderland in the quad, where we're giving away catalogues of next semester's classes. Whoa, what's that sound? Is that the tippy-tapping of secular boots on the roof? Oh, well, it must be yet another sign that it 'tis the season, because rumor has it that non-denominational Mr. Winter is on his way to the student lounge!
	Speaker: dean	Listeners: self
Unh!


	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: group
I'm so sick of the Dean jamming his PC down my throat.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: pierce
Pierce, I'd like to commend you for letting that one go.
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: self
"PC-ness."
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: pierce
Now I get it. It sounds like "penis". I just got it too.
	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: group
Well, it's still Christmas to all of us, and I made you all a little gift, because you're like my new family.
	Speaker: annie	Listeners: shirley
"W-W-B-J-D"?
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: troy
If this stands for "What would Billy Joel do", I'll tell you right now... he'd write another crappy song.
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: pierce
Yeah, in your face, Billy Joel.
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: group
Who is that?
	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: group
It stands for "What would baby Jesus do?" And it's to remind us that the real meaning of this season is Christmas.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: shirley
Oh, well, thank you, Shirley. I'm gonna put that in the pocket closest to my heart.
	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: britta
No, no, no, it's a bracelet. You put 'em on.
	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: group
Everybody put 'em on.


	Speaker: thug	Listeners: abed
Hey. Hey! You took all the winter-doodles. What are you, a douche bag?
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: thug
They're for my friends. There's a lot of other cookies left.
	Speaker: thug	Listeners: abed
No, there's only macadamia nut cookies there, okay? I have a tree-nut allergy.
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: thug
You should probably stay away from Christmas-tree-shaped cookies.
	Speaker: thug	Listeners: abed
Ha ha! That did not even make allergic sense. What are you, an idiot?
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: thug
Okay, we get it. You and the A-team are awesome. Now beat it.
	Speaker: thug	Listeners: jeff
Oh, look at that. Pretty boy standing up for bird face over here. Give me a winter-doodle.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: thug
If you're trying to be menacing, maybe don't call the cookie by its name.
	Speaker: thug	Listeners: jeff
Oh, you're funny. You're a funny man. Want to hear something funny, funny man? Knock, knock. My fist up your balls!
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: thug
Who's there?
	Speaker: dean	Listeners: all
Ha ha ha! Merry happy!
	Speaker: thug	Listeners: jeff
This ain't over. There won't always be a Dean around. All right?


	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: abed
Still waiting on those cookies, Abed.
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: group
Jeff protected my honor. It was like my bodyguard, but I was the kid from meatballs, Jeff was the guy from full metal jacket, and the moustache guy was the brother of the guy on entourage.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: abed
Thanks for dumbing that down for us.
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: jeff
You got it.
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: jeff
So what's the deal, Jeff? You leave your stones in your other suit? Why didn't you rap that guy in the face?
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: pierce
For the same reason that I floss, have a bed frame, and keep my guitar in its case... I'm over 23.
	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: jeff
I'm proud of you for handling it peacefully, Jeff, like a certain little birthday boy. Real men turn the other cheek.
	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: group
Let's see 'em.
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: group
Nonsense. Men were wired to fight each other so that women could choose the right mate.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: pierce
No, the real reason men fight is to release their pent-up gayness.
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: britta
That guy wasn't gay. He had a moustache.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: group
You know what I have? Finals. Are we cramming for Spanish or not? I need a 65, or I'm gonna flunk the class.
	Speaker: annie	Listeners: jeff
Why didn't you do the extra-credit assignments if you knew that you were... failing?
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: abed
Because doing more than the minimum work is my definition of... failing.
	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: group
Quick question... Are you all coming to my Christmas party right after the final, or are you stopping home to change into your Christmas outfits?
	Speaker: annie	Listeners: shirley
I guess I could wear one of my Hanukah sweaters.
	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: annie
Uh, Annie... I... I didn't know you weren't, um, Christian.
	Speaker: annie	Listeners: shirley
Yep. One might even say I'm Jewish.
	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: annie
Oh, t... that's good for you. T... that's wonderful. I respect all religions of the world.
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: group
I'm Muslim.
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: group
Jehovah's witness.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: group
Atheist.
	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: self
The Lord is testing me.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: group
Guys, this is a subject that breeds conflicts. Can we please do...
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: jeff
What religion are you, Jeff?
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: group
I'm agnostic.
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: jeff
Agnostic... lazy man's atheist.
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: group
I'm born-again.
	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: pierce
Oh.
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: group
Yeah, we had a re-birthing ritual in my friend's hot tub. I'm now a level-five laser lotus in my Buddhist community.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: pierce
Uh, that does not sound like Buddhism. Are you sure you're not in a cult?
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: britta
Just by asking me that question, you've put me back down to a level four. You now owe me 2,000 Energon cubes.
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: pierce
Do you know how foolish you sound right now? What else do you believe in, blood transfusions?
	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: pierce
Jehovah's witnesses are a type of Christian, right, Troy?
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: group
Yeah, but we don't celebrate birthdays or Christmas, and we can't drink. But it helps.
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: troy
So you're like a Muslim. Salaam alaikum.
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: abed
Shama-lama-ding-dong.
	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: group
Wow, don't we have a diverse little family. I say we open up this... this party to all faiths. I brought my star of Bethlehem, which led the wise men to the savior of all mankind. And you guys can bring a little trinket or doodad from your philosophies. Sounds good?
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: group
As an agnostic, I'm gonna bring my winning smile.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: self
That's not enough.


	Speaker: chang	Listeners: self
Ugh! So boring.
	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: all
Done. Hee hee. Hee hee. Hmm. Feliz Navidad.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: chang
"True or falso or none of the above?" That doesn't make any sense.


	Speaker: thug	Listeners: jeff
Hey, look at that. Forehead's taking a test.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: thug
Why don't you get going, Chuck Norris?
	Speaker: thug	Listeners: jeff
Did you just shoo me?
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: jeff thug
Why don't you just kiss him already?
	Speaker: thug	Listeners: jeff
Dude, I will shoo your nose down your throat!
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: chang
Senor Chang, can you do something about this?
	Speaker: chang	Listeners: jeff
I'll allow it.
	Speaker: thug	Listeners: jeff
Que pasa here, huh? It's usted, dude. Even I know that.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: thug
You picked the wrong day to correct my Spanish, no sleeves. It's on!
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: thug
He's doing this for me. He's my bodyguard.
	Speaker: thug	Listeners: jeff
You wanna dance?
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: thug jeff
Maybe to some show tunes?
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: thug
No, I want to beat the crap out of you. And I'm gonna enjoy it, because you're just like this school. You're obnoxious, you're cramping my style, and you smell like French-fry oil.
	Speaker: thug	Listeners: jeff
I don't get it!
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: thug
Three O'clock, bike rack, But not the one by the parking lot!
	Speaker: thug	Listeners: jeff
Right! The one by the trash cans near the orange cones where they're building the wheelchair ramp!
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: thug
Yeah.
	Speaker: chang	Listeners: all
Best exam ever. That guy's awesome, man.


	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: pierce
So help me if that jerk-weed made me fail.
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: jeff
Well, I aced it, amigo. That means "cousin".
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: jeff
So what's my role going to be in the fight? Is there a key moment where I finally stand up for myself and take revenge on the villain?
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: abed
Uh, maybe you should just hang back.
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: jeff
Yeah I will. In his face!
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: abed troy pierce
Whatever you do, don't tell Shirley about the fight. She'll start in with all her mother-y, guilt-inducing powers. You know what I mean?
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: jeff
No. I'm wearing this Jesus bracelet 'cause it gets me chicks.
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: jeff
I know guys like this Mike. He used to be a nerd. Now he's a meathead. Dangerous combo. Tyson, Lou Ferrigno, Rosie O'Donnell.
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: jeff
You're a pretty big dude. Probably got some moves.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: troy
Yeah, I got some... theories.
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: jeff
You've never been in a fight?
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: abed troy
Technically, no. I guess I'm too charming and likable. Call me a name.
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: jeff
I can't.
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: jeff
Are you telling me you've never been punched in the face?
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: pierce
No, thank God. This is the moneymaker.
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: jeff
First time I got punched in the face, I was like, "Oh, no!" But then I was like, "This is a story".
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: troy
And a good one.
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: jeff
Yeah.
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: jeff
Every man should be punched in the face. It's a rite of passage. In my day, Friday night was smoke a doobie, feel up a gal, and then get your teeth knocked out by a republican.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: pierce
Guys the plan here isn't for me to get hit. It's for me to hit him.
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: troy abed
Oh, then it's settled. We have to teach Jeffrey how to fight. I know a few moves.
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: troy
Troy, I assume you're handy with a switchblade.
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: abed
Abed, you get back to the family tent, try to find a chicken for Jeff to Chase.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: troy abed pierce
Guys, I appreciate the enthusiasm, but, uh, I think I got this.


	Speaker: thug	Listeners: jeff
Oh, well, look who it is. We got forehead, old head, dumb head, and, uh... the other head. See you at 3:00, forehead.
	Speaker: thug	Listeners: extra
Give me a snowman, dork!
	Speaker: thug	Listeners: jeff
See this, funny guy? Huh? Huh?


	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: all
Classic Rosie.
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: jeff
Fight lessons in a half an hour?
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: troy
Good plan.


	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: annie
Hello. Oh. Is this your Hanukkah holder? It's, uh... it's pretty. We'll just, uh... Let's just put it... There we go. That's nice. So I can't believe I never knew you were a Jew.
	Speaker: annie	Listeners: shirley
I'd say the whole word next time.
	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: annie
So, uh, do you think everyone will start arriving soon?
	Speaker: annie	Listeners: shirley
I think they're gonna come after Jeff's fight.
	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: annie
After Jeff's what now?
	Speaker: annie	Listeners: shirley
Jeff wants to fight that bully.
	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: annie
On Christmas? Um, will you excuse me for a moment? And can you finish the manger scene?
	Speaker: annie	Listeners: babyjesus
We know you were one of us.


	Speaker: troy	Listeners: jeff
'Sup? 'Sup?
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: troy
'Sup!
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: jeff
No, it's a question. 'Sup?
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: troy
'Sup?
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: jeff
Not a real question, a rhetorical one. You have the answer. He does not. Okay, then you give him the forest Whitaker eye.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: troy
That's pretty good.
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: jeff
Mm-hmm. Okay, hold that stare. There you go. Hold it. Then you look straight through his eyes and deep into his soul.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: jeff troy
And then you move to Vermont.
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: britta
I am sick and tired of you saying that fighting is gay!
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: troy britta
She's got a point. You know, in boxing, you fight for the purse and the belt.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: abed
I've gotta write a paper about that.
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: jeff
All right, I've seen enough. Let's see what we're working with. Go ahead, throw a few at the old paws. What are you, a North Korean seamstress?
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: pierce
Not if that's bad.
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: jeff
Get mad! Come on! If it helps, think of me as somebody who annoys you. Ooh, that's it! That's... that's good.
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: britta
Britta, put your blouse back on.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: self
Oh! Ow!
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: jeff
Boys, this is not a game. You gotta be ready for anything.
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: pierce
Dude, that is not cool!
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: troy
Well, that foxy Black girl thinks it is.
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: self
Hmm? Ow!
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: pierce
What are you doing?
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: pierce
Why does she have to be black?


	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: group
What is going on?
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: shirley
We're trying to get Jeff ready for the fiiiii...iiight.
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: jeff
I couldn't think of another word.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: troy
Idiot.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: shirley
He meant we were figh... ...ting.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: troy
It is hard to think of another word.
	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: jeff
You realize there's no other way for me to take this than as a giant middle finger to the most important day of the year.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: shirley
December 10th?
	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: group
It's our Christmas, and I'm having a party. Due to my divorce and my relatives picking sides, this will be the only Christmas party I throw this year. Will you be there, or will I have another family letting me down?
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: shirley
I told him not to fight. He wouldn't listen. I don't know what that is.
	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: jeff
Jeffrey, I have two boys. And when we have a serious discussion, I find that a brownie helps them to relax. So why do you hate me and Jesus?
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: shirley
I don't think my brownie's working.
	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: jeff
Please don't do something so ugly on a day so important to me.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: shirley
Again, it's December 10th.
	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: jeff
You think religion is stupid?
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: shirley
No, no. To me, religion is like Paul Rudd. I see the appeal, and I would never take it away from anyone. But I would also never stand in line for it. And look, Shirley, the die has been cast with this crazy bully guy. He picked on Abed, and he corrected my Spanish. So you go to your party, and I'll see you soon.
	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: jeff
Jeffrey, I forbid you from fighting.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: shirley
Well, you don't get to. You're not my mom.
	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: jeff
You're right. But if you show up for the fight, don't show up for my party.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: shirley
Oh, come on, Shirley, don't be mad.
	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: jeff
I'm not mad. I'm disappointed.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: shirley
That's "mom" for mad.


	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: annie
Oh, hash browns and applesauce... That's nice.
	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: abed
Oh, what is that interesting smell?
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: shirley
It's a traditional Muslim dish.
	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: abed
It looks delicious. I'm guessing as a woman I won't be allowed to eat that. That's too bad.
	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: britta
Oh, look, Britta brought what she believes in... nothing.
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: britta
Where should I put my Buddha incense holder?
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: pierce
I'm pretty sure that's a bong.


	Speaker: annie	Listeners: group
Where's Jeff?
	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: group
I guess he made his choice.
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: group
I want to go to Jeff's fight.
	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: group
As I told Jeff, no one that goes to the fight can come to my party. He's dead to me. And if any of you leave, you'll be dead to me too. Let's sing. # Jesus is a friend of mine # everybody! # Jesus is a friend of mine # Come on, everybody. You don't know it?
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: shirley
You're banning Jeff from the party? That doesn't seem very Christian.
	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: britta
Well, that's an interesting point of view coming from an atheist.
	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: group
I did my best to create a special Christmas for my one intact family, and... this is the thanks I get.
	Speaker: annie	Listeners: shirley
Shirley, you are a guilt machine.
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: annie
And Annie knows a thing or two about guilt. Am I right, Jew?
	Speaker: annie	Listeners: pierce
Say the whole word!
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: annie
Jewie?
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: pierce
You would never catch a Jehovah's witness saying "Jewie".
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: self
Tell it to the birthday cake you never got.
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: troy
You know, there's an old Buddhist saying in my vision group...
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: pierce
You are not a Buddhist. You are in a cult.
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: britta
Suck it, Nietzsche!
	Speaker: annie	Listeners: group
Guys, everyone's faith is weird. Let's just not talk about it.
	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: group
There's nothing weird about Christianity.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: group
Guys! Guys! Guys! Guys! Are we really gonna let religion divide us like this? I think there's one thing we can all agree on.
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: britta
I get 72 virgins in heaven.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: abed
No.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: group
That we would all like to have Jeff at this party.
	Speaker: annie	Listeners: self
Mm-mm.
	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: britta
He can't come.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: shirley
Shirley.
	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: self
Mm-mm.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: shirley
Shirley, listen. I get that this is your first Christmas since your husband left you, and I don't know, maybe that's why you're being so stubborn, because you're trying so hard to re-create something that you're afraid that you've lost forever. But if you really want us to be your second family, then you've gotta start treating us like one, even if that means supporting us when we do things that you don't agree with. You can start by rooting for Jeff while he rolls around on the ground groping another man. That's what I'm gonna do.
	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: group
The cranberry sauce has real cranberries.


	Speaker: thug	Listeners: extra
Look, if he doesn't show up, We're definitely going to Applebee's, right?
	Speaker: extra	Listeners: thug
Yeah.
	Speaker: thug	Listeners: extra
I'm getting into a fight no matter what today, dude. No matter what! Look who showed. Oh, check him out. Ahh...ahh!


	Speaker: thug	Listeners: jeff
What's up, dude? No backup today? Huh? Looks like grandpa and weirdo couldn't show up to get their teeth knocked out, huh?
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: thug
Can I ask you a question? Are you perpetually on your way to the gym?
	Speaker: thug	Listeners: jeff
Dude, my life is a gym!
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: thug
Well, 'sup?
	Speaker: thug	Listeners: jeff
'Sup, man?
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: thug
'Sup?
	Speaker: thug	Listeners: jeff
'Sup?
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: thug
'Sup? 'Sup?
	Speaker: thug	Listeners: jeff
'Sup? 'Sup?
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: thug
'Sup? 'Sup?
	Speaker: thug	Listeners: jeff
'Sup? 'Sup?
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: thug
'Sup? 'Sup?
	Speaker: thug	Listeners: jeff
Whoa. Dude, what is that?
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: thug
All right, just one sec. These are very expensive. All right...
	Speaker: thug	Listeners: jeff
Dude, you wear a bracelet?
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: thug
Your name's Mike, right?
	Speaker: thyg	Listeners: jeff
So?
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: thug
Mike, I'm not gonna fight you. I have a friend that believes this is the time of year where you put aside your differences, and you make peace. Me... I don't believe in any of that, but I do believe in friendship. And as much as I hate you and the cast of breakin', I have to ask myself, what would Shirley do?
	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: self
Oh!
	Speaker: thug	Listeners: jeff
What would Shirley do?
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: thug
I think...
	Speaker: thug	Listeners: jeff
What would Shirley do?
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: thug
That she would shake your hand and wish you a Merry Christmas.
	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: jeff
Jeffrey... Kick his ass!
	Speaker: thug	Listeners: extra
Cavalry's here. Shirts off, boys!
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: all
Come on, I'm being punked, right?
	Speaker: thug	Listeners: extra
Come here. Come here.


	Speaker: extra	Listeners: shirley
Please, it's Christmas.
	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: extra
It's December 10th!
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: thug
Not the moneymaker. Not the moneymaker!
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: jeff
You're welcome!


	Speaker: annie	Listeners: shirley
Yeah! That was really good.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: shirley
Yeah!
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: shirley
That was nice.


	Speaker: chang	Listeners: group
Thank you, thank you. I get it, yes. It is I, Senior Chang.
	Speaker: chang	Listeners: shirley
Shakira, hold this.
	Speaker: chang	Listeners: group
So... I have finished grading everyone's finals, and all of you are moving on. Heh heh heh, except... for Jeff.
	Speaker: chang	Listeners: jeff
Turns out you... pause for dramatic effect... will be seeing me next semester.
	Speaker: annie	Listeners: self
Noooooooo!
	Speaker: chang	Listeners: group
In Spanish 102! Heh heh heh. Because he passed, you know. And I'm the only Spanish teacher.
	Speaker: annie	Listeners: chang
Yay! I meant about Jeff passing. You being our Spanish teacher, eh.
	Speaker: chang	Listeners: jeff
Whoa. Man, Mike got you good.
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: chang
Actually, uh, that was my present to Jeff.
	Speaker: chang	Listeners: pierce
I don't care. I got a Mountain to shred.
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: jeff
Jeffrey, you're a man now. How's it feel?
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: pierce
I got hit in the face, like, four times before you punched me.
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: jeff
Some people just don't know how to say thank you.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: pierce
Pierce, thank you.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: group
And thanks to all of you for showing up and having my back when we fought those fly dancers. So, uh... Merry...
	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: group
No, no, no, no, no. Holiday.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: shirley
Actually, I was gonna say merry semester and happy new one.


	Speaker: abed	Listeners: troy
Oh Christmas Troy, oh Christmas Troy, thy candles shine so brightly. Oh Christmas Troy, oh Christmas Troy, much pleasure thou canst give me.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: troy abed
Why do you guys do stuff like this?
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: jeff
'cause it's fun?
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: troy
Don't move
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: abed
This nose smells like the special drink

	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: group
welcome back!
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: shirley
Hi.
	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: group
Hello. What did you do over break?
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: group
Oh, it was so awesome. Me and abed played this video game. It is so dope. It's a whole city.
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: group
You can drive anywhere.
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: group
You can rent an apartment.
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: group
You could do your taxes.
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: group
But don't get audited 'cause that's bad.
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: group
You could even enroll in community college.
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: group
Right now it sounds as boring as real life, But it is not.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: abed troy
Vacations are wasted on the young. You guys gotta get out there and see the world at some point Or you're gonna miss your entire lives.
	Speaker: annie	Listeners: britta
Where did you go, britta?
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: annie
Amsterdam, I think. I'll know more when I find my camera.
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: group
Guess what happened to me.
	Speaker: annie	Listeners: pierce
Oh, pierce, you became a grandfather?
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: annie
No, I became even cooler. These ironic tee shirts are all the rage.


	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: group
Let's get one thing straight. I wish I was still a lawyer. I'm only here because I'm hot for britta, And I don't want to be anybody's friend. Just kidding. Bring it in here, ya knuckleheads! You know, I gotta say I took a look back At the guy I was last semester, And I realized that guy was a drag.
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: jeff
Good to hear you admit it, jeff.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: group
No, the truth is this is a new semester, A new jeff. Greendale is where I am, And I am gonna make the best of it.
	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: jeff
That is nice.
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: jeff
You're like hawkeye on m.A.S.H. He kept his upbeat humor and charm Even in the 11th year of the korean war.


	Speaker: buddy	Listeners: jeff
Yeah, well, don't go changing too much, jeff. I think we all like you just the way you were.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: buddy
Well, I appreciate that, but-- Did you just teleport here?
	Speaker: buddy	Listeners: jeff
No, I snuck in during the group hug.
	Speaker: buddy	Listeners: group
You guys don't remember me? Buddy...From spanish class?
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: buddy
I've never seen you before in my life.
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: group
I've seen buddy before. He sits in the corner next to the dead plant.
	Speaker: buddy	Listeners: group
Thank you, abed. Sometimes I have a tendency to melt into the background. It's just my body type. But I definitely know you guys From watching you all last semester grow together.


	Speaker: chang	Listeners: jeff pierce
"f." "f"-minus.
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: chang
Did you say "s"?
	Speaker: buddy	Listeners: pierce
He said "f."


	Speaker: chang	Listeners: all
Who cheated?
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: chang
I did it.
	Speaker: buddy	Listeners: self
Britta cheated? But why?


	Speaker: britta	Listeners: annie
Gimme back my bra, annie.
	Speaker: annie	Listeners: britta
I'm not even wearing a bra.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: annie
Oh!
	Speaker: buddy	Listeners: self
I don't even care who wins.


	Speaker: britta	Listeners: buddy
What?
	Speaker: buddy	Listeners: britta
I sleep a lot in class. That one might have been a dream.
	Speaker: annie	Listeners: buddy
Well, buddy, as you know, We haven't had spanish class yet. So this meeting was more just for catching up... Between friends.
	Speaker: buddy	Listeners: group
I heard that. Let's do it!
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: buddy
Well--
	Speaker: buddy	Listeners: group
so--sorry, britta. I'll go first. Uh, I'm sure you guys have a natural rapport and timing, And, you know, you're scared that adding a new member Might throw everything off of its natural rhythm. I feel like I know you guys already. So you know, let me in. Just tell me the rules, And I will follow.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: buddy
Well, you already broke the only rule I have. The rule about worrying about rules.
	Speaker: buddy	Listeners: jeff
That's what I'm saying too!
	Speaker: buddy	Listeners: group
Yeah! "spanish studyin' is better when you're buddyin' around, yeah"


	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: extra
Excuse me, I received a text message About free sephora samples.
	Speaker: dean	Listeners: jeff
Ha ha! It was me. Sorry about the ruse, but I have something better Than exfoliating soap to rub on you. An opportunity. Mm. As you can see, I am resurrecting The greendale gazette journal mirror! And we need a student editor. Someone with real world savvy That extends beyond how to huff the ink.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: dean
Actually, dean, I'm resolved to spend this semester Being more...
	Speaker: dean	Listeners: jeff
This would be your office.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: dean
Relaxed...And awesome. This is the first desk I've seen in six months That doesn't have "zeppelin rules" carved into it.
	Speaker: dean	Listeners: jeff
And you get an english credit.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: dean
Well, that ain't bad neither. I'm in.


	Speaker: dean	Listeners: all
Guys, meet your new editor! Mr. Winger is very excited to help you bring a voice Back to the campus.
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: jeff
Jeff, I need to take your picture. We got it.
	Speaker: dean	Listeners: all
Okay. You guys knock yourselves out!


	Speaker: reporter1	Listeners: jeff
Welcome aboard, Jeff. This is my article on the school's new water heater.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: reporter1
You got chops, kid, but we need your talent On a bigger story. Pizza wars--who's got the best slice in town? Start with big nick's. Bring us a large, with sausage.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: reporter2
You. I heard a rumor that riley's liquor is Selling to underage students. I need an undercover expose. Find out how much they'll sell you Of anything cold and imported.


	Speaker: annie	Listeners: jeff
You expect me to watch you do that Without telling on you?
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: annie
That's a hard-hitting question, annie. Are you a reporter?
	Speaker: annie	Listeners: jeff
No, they've got me editing the crossword Because I'm a girl. And because I love crosswords.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: annie
Well, now you love the streets. You're my ace news hound.
	Speaker: annie	Listeners: jeff
Ace? You can do that?
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: annie
We can do anything we want. It's greendale. Now go find me that story.


	Speaker: abed	Listeners: jeff
This character reboot is really gelling for you, jeff. That was all classic hawkeye. Sending soldiers out for liquor. Slyly sidestepping the problematic scrutiny Of annie "hot lips" edison. I should build you a still for making hawkeye martinis.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: abed
Of all your pop culture fixations, This is one I can work with, abed.
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: jeff
Call me radar.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: abed
When you've earned it.


	Speaker: extra	Listeners: all
Now, I know the news of senor chang's death Over winter break was a shock to us all. But we should take comfort in the fact That he did not suffer When his moped hit the side of that arby's.
	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: group
So sad. But best semester ever.
	Speaker: chang	Listeners: all
Feliz ano nueva, chicas!
	Speaker: chang	Listeners: extra
beat it. All right.
	Speaker: chang	Listeners: all
That was a professional actress. I am a man who can never die. And this has been your first taste Of spanish 1-0- dos-- The semester I get inside your cabesas!
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: group
I saw that coming.


	Speaker: buddy	Listeners: group
Hey, guys, see you in study group. Hoo-ah!
	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: jeff
Uh, jeff, can he really just decide he's one of us?
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: jeff
He throws off our balance. We've got three chicks, three dudes, And now two weirdos.
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: abed
Sorry, abed.
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: jeff
Not all weirdos are bad. But he might be a puckish agent of change That changes our lives for the better Through a musical montage.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: jeff
Or he could have a row of jars Waiting for our genitals.
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: jeff
Yo, I need my genitals.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: group
You know who you guys sound like? Me, from last semester. Cynical, elitist, Rakishly good-looking.
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: jeff
Thank you.
	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: jeff
Well, we should at least get together To talk about membership policies, right?
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: group
Hey, don't ask me. Dealing with problems ain't my job no more. My new job is hanging out, having fun, And cracking wise.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: jeff
Oh, it must be nice. Suppose I decide that's my job.


	Speaker: annie	Listeners: jeff
Jeff, I hope you've got an army of raisins Because I've got a major scoop. In October, There was a free toni braxton concert on the quad.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: annie
You don't need to remind me.
	Speaker: annie	Listeners: jeff
And when a last-minute mix-up Shifted the show time by an hour, An anonymous text message went out Alerting students of the change.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: annie
Okay.
	Speaker: annie	Listeners: jeff
Not okay. Because the text message was sent exclusively To black students... And one french kid named lebron. That's profiling. This is front-page juice. Just gotta find out who sent the text.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: annie
Have you called the number that sent it?
	Speaker: annie	Listeners: jeff
Well...Nobody's that stupid, right?


	Speaker: dean	Listeners: phone
Aw... Hello? Um... wrong number.
	Speaker: dean	Listeners: self
No, that-- that was a good cover.


	Speaker: annie	Listeners: group
So whoever it is keeps hanging up, But he can't hide forever.
	Speaker: buddy	Listeners: annie
Annie the reporter. Good times.
	Speaker: buddy	Listeners: group
Listen up. I just want to say Thank you guys real much-- much--real much? Duh! Thank you guys very much for this. It's a dream come true. Now let's study some spanish.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: buddy
So for the essay, we conjugate...
	Speaker: buddy	Listeners: britta
Conjugate. Conjugal visit!
	Speaker: buddy	Listeners: group
lame. Okay, stick and move. Stick and move.
	Speaker: annie	Listeners: group
Okay, so for the essay portion...
	Speaker: buddy	Listeners: annie
annie got an essay portion annie gonna move her luscious fanny all day long
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: group
Hey, buddy can sing, you guys. Wow, that's great.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: buddy
Annie's pretty young. We try not to sexualize her.
	Speaker: buddy	Listeners: group
I'm sorry. Whoa! Okay, look, I-- you know what, It's your study group, And I don't know if you perceive it As something that could be improved, But I do have some ideas. Here's the one right here. Boom. I was thinking, as a group, We could start saying, "you go, girl." Not in a way that's, you know, "oh, I'm so cool saying "you go, girl." But in a way that we're kinda winking at it. Bottom line, you guys need a chubby, agile guy. Did anyone see paul blart: Marl cop, Paul. Blart. Mall. Cop. I'm like that, okay? I'm fat and I'm... Physical, okay? And I'm strong. Hmm? And I can kick.
	Speaker: buddy	Listeners: jeff
Dude, sorry. Jeff
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: buddy
no, no, it's fine, it's fine. It's just a little nosebleed. I get 'em when it's dry And when my face gets kicked.
	Speaker: buddy	Listeners: jeff
I'll get some paper towels.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: group
Did someone say something about a meeting To discuss member policy?


	Speaker: britta	Listeners: group
Well, I think it's obvious to everyone That this buddy fellow has a few froot loops loose. So I think no matter what we do, We gotta do it with grace and caution.
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: group
I say we keep buddy in the group.
	Speaker: annie	Listeners: pierce
What?
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: group
I've given it a lot of thought, and frankly I like his in-your-face style.
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: group
I can't stop thinking about his high kick. His ratio of girth to hip flexibility Is mesmerizing.
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: group
I like his idea of ironically saying "you go, girl."
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: abed
You go, girl.
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: troy
You go, girl.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: group
Wait, so you kick high enough and you get in the group?
	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: group
If we're going to add people, I really think we should consider my friend gary.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: shirley
I'm sorry, shirley, Your friend gary is so boring.
	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: britta
He was raised in finland. He doesn't get our humor.
	Speaker: annie	Listeners: group
Well, if we're gonna add a chair For every bong-ripping good-time charlie With a song in his heart, I move we institute hazing.
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: group
Well, in the right stuff, the novel by tom wolfe--
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: group
This is why we need new blood. I'm so bored of you pop culture references And your cigarette-legged jeans.
	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: group
My friend gary wears nothing but loose-fitting jeans.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: shirley
Gary is off the table. He is a buzz kill.
	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: britta
He grew up in a land without sun!
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: pierce
Why don't you like my tight jeans?
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: britta
Take a vote.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: jeff
They'll probably vote him in.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: britta
They won't.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: group
Guys, guys, let's take a vote.
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: group
Secret vote. Everybody cover your eyes.
	Speaker: annie	Listeners: group
We won't know the result.
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: group
Well, say your vote out loud.
	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: group
We'll know each other's voices.
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: group
Troy's got a point.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: group
Holy crap. Wow. It says here some guy in seattle went nuts And killed his entire driver's ed class With a meat tenderizer.
	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: group
Oh, no. We have to be careful.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: group
Okay... On the count of three, Everybody who wants to keep buddy out, Raise your hand.


	Speaker: abed	Listeners: jeff
You lied about the guy in seattle With the meat tenderizer. You put your thumb on the scale. But you did it with a smile, And you did it so you could keep smiling. You're hawkeye.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: abed
And with buddy gone, Staying that way will be a lot easier.


	Speaker: dean	Listeners: annie
I am not racist! I had 20 minutes to let people know That toni braxton was starting early And 273 text messages left before my rate tripled. Racial profiling may not be right, But it can be economical.
	Speaker: annie	Listeners: dean
Tell me, dean, when I refer to you in my article, Would you prefer "imbecile" or "incompetent?"
	Speaker: dean	Listeners: annie
I prefer "incompetent," but what I really want--
	Speaker: annie	Listeners: dean
It doesn't matter what you want. The people want the truth. I have to give it to them. And I won't let anyone stand in my way. Excuse me.
	Speaker: dean	Listeners: annie
Okay.
	Speaker: annie	Listeners: dean
Thank you.


	Speaker: dean	Listeners: jeff
Jeffrey, I am the least racist person in the world. My best friend when I was six years old was a black man. Look, I've learned my lesson. I've got unlimited texting now. But if she runs that story, I will lose this job. And this job is my life. She listens to you.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: dean
Well, next time we're both hanging out having fun I could try cracking wise about it with her.
	Speaker: dean	Listeners: jeff
You do what you think is right.


	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: abed
That's enough.
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: jeff
Okay.


	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: annie
I'm just saying it's not exactly watergate. I mean, you like the dean. He's trying to help you transfer.
	Speaker: annie	Listeners: jeff
Yeah, and this time he might succeed. If this article breaks out, I can apply for journalism scholarships. Nobody will care about my time in rehab If they think I'm a writer.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: annie
Annie, as your upbeat friend, I gotta say let this go.
	Speaker: annie	Listeners: jeff
This is greendale, jeff. We can do whatever we want.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: annie
Didn't anyone tell buddy he was out?
	Speaker: annie	Listeners: jeff
I guess we thought you would.


	Speaker: buddy	Listeners: jeff annie
Milord, milady. You missed my apology song.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: buddy
Yeah, I'll tell 'em about it later.
	Speaker: buddy	Listeners: jeff
Jeff... I am so sorry about the other day.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: buddy
Buddy, yesterday the group took a vote. And you seem to have figured out the rest of it.
	Speaker: buddy	Listeners: jeff
Was it the high kick? Was it "you go, girl"? Oh, you guys think you're so cool.
	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: buddy
No, we don't think we're cool at all.
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: buddy
A little bit.
	Speaker: buddy	Listeners: group
I put myself out there for you! I laid my soul bare! I made you guys lemon squares with free-range eggs That I baked with my own hands.
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: buddy
Maybe a little less sugar next time.
	Speaker: buddy	Listeners: group
Well, I'm not leaving.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: buddy
Oh, come on. Be relaxed, like me. Leave.
	Speaker: buddy	Listeners: group
You're not relaxed. You're an uptight puppet master, And these are all your little puppets.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: buddy
Buddy, just be reasonable and go.
	Speaker: buddy	Listeners: jeff
Make me...Hitler.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: buddy
Okay, so since buddy's not leaving, He'll just be the person who we wish wasn't here While we study. Try getting that deal from hitler. Shall we?
	Speaker: buddy	Listeners: jeff
I'm studying with you.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: buddy
No, you're not.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: group
Everyone stop studying.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: buddy
You're not in the group.
	Speaker: buddy	Listeners: jeff
Okay, then go study somewhere else.
	Speaker: buddy	Listeners: self
Hola, mi amigo. Donde estas la bibliota?
	Speaker: buddy	Listeners: jeff
No, no. No, no, no, no! No, no, no! No, I want to study spanish! No! Noooooooooo! Ah, I hate you! I hate your study group! I hate it! You suck! Aah... I hate you!


	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: annie
And you are not running that story!
	Speaker: annie	Listeners: jeff
Why not?
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: annie
Because I said so!
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: group
Does anybody have a problem with how that was handled?
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: jeff
It's exactly the way I would have done it, jeff.


	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: abed
Who are you kidding, abed? I just dragged a screaming, crying man Out of a library with his pants down. No. Martinis are for hawkeyes. I'm the same uptight jerk I was last semester.
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: jeff
Jeff, what's your favorite episode of M.A.S.H.?
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: abed
The one with, uh, the army.
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: jeff
That's what I thought. If you'd ever actually seen the show, You'd know that hawkeye doesn't just bed nurses And drink martinis. He also had blood sprayed on his face And barked orders when the choppers came in. If he didn't, people died. He was a leader, jeff. That's your job.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: abed
Ooh. What's in it for me?


	Speaker: annie	Listeners: jeff
Hey...
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: annie
Annie, I'm sorry that I yelled.
	Speaker: annie	Listeners: jeff
I'm glad you did. It didn't even really occur to me what I was doing Until I saw how upset you were. And I never want to be the reason you're mad Because... You're jeff winger. So...Thanks... For getting mad.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: annie
Well, it was nothing.


	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: abed
I guess that's the upside, isn't it? Thank you...Radar.
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: jeff
Ooh, you made me so happy I just peed a little.


	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: group
I don't think violence is the answer When we make decisions about--
	Speaker: buddy	Listeners: group
Hi, guys.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: buddy
Hi, buddy. Can you, um...
	Speaker: annie	Listeners: buddy
Excuse us...
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: buddy
For one... Crazy stalker?
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: group
Listen up. We outnumber this guy six to one. Annie, you flash your breasts as a decoy for the bum rush.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: pierce
Pierce!
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: britta
Don't be upset. I didn't pick you as a decoy 'cause your breasts are so old.
	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: group
Why is he even here?
	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: buddy
Hello.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: group
I invited him. Buddy's crime is thinking we're cool. But I get it. I mean, if I were him And I missed out on you guys, I'd be sitting in that classroom, Watching, wondering. So how can I exclude someone from something That I'm so lucky to have? I say we let him in.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: buddy
Hi, buddy. Welcome to the group.
	Speaker: buddy	Listeners: group
Oh, yes! You will not regret this.


	Speaker: starburns	Listeners: owenwilson
There he is. Speak of the devil, he's right there.
	Speaker: owenwilson	Listeners: buddy
Hey, buddy.
	Speaker: buddy	Listeners: owenwilson
Hmm?
	Speaker: owenwilson	Listeners: buddy
The group thought about what you said. We took a vote, and you're in.
	Speaker: buddy	Listeners: all
Oh ho, no way! I'm in the cool group?
	Speaker: owenwilson	Listeners: buddy
Look at him. It's like christmas morning for the guy. Welcome.
	Speaker: buddy	Listeners: group
Oh...This is-- Oh, this is awkward. You guys were my safe date.
	Speaker: owenwilson	Listeners: buddy
Hey, buddy, you don't have to worry about them. You're with us now. Come on.
	Speaker: buddy	Listeners: self
Ha ha! Boom!
	Speaker: owenwilson	Listeners: starburns
I love the kicks.
	Speaker: starburns	Listeners: owenwilson
He's amazing!
	Speaker: owenwilson	Listeners: starburns
The kicks are the best. He's just got that kind of-- You know when some people have it...
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: group
And that, ladies and gentlemen, Is why I voted to keep him.
	Speaker: annie	Listeners: group
It would have been nice to have Another person in the group.
	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: group
I'll call gary.


	Speaker: starburns	Listeners: troy abed
So, it says here that you want to join as two-some, I don't see it as a selling point.
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: starburns
We work really well together
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: starburns
Yeah
	Speaker: starburns	Listeners: abed troy
Let me hear that rap thing of yours again.
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: starburns
Me llamo T-Bone la arana discoteca
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: starburns
Discoteca, muneca, la biblioteca
	Speaker: starburns	Listeners: abed troy
Alright, I'll talk it over with the others
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: starburns
Thanks for your time
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: starburns
Alright


	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: abed troy
You traitors! I'm appalled that your lack of loyalty. Yeah, you better run


	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: starburns
Have you decided?
	Speaker: starburns	Listeners: pierce
We saw your tape. We're passing
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: starburns
I don't pop in video. Let me do the song in person. Getting rid of Britta. Getting rid of the B. She's the GDB. She's a... no good B

	Speaker: annie	Listeners: group
Before we start, I'd like to have a preliminary powwow, or prelimi-wow, about what I'm calling our library's backdoor conundrum.
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: annie
Sounds like a porno with Kate Winslet.
	Speaker: annie	Listeners: abed
Abed, ew.
	Speaker: annie	Listeners: group
The door on that side is locked after 5:00, which means that most of us have to walk all the way around. Now, if we were to move our meetings to 4:30...
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: annie
No.
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: annie
No.
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: annie
I have a regular class at that time. It's like math or other regular classes.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: annie
I have something unimportant that can't ever move.
	Speaker: annie	Listeners: group
Well, maybe one of us could stand by the back door and let the rest in?
	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: group
I nominate Pierce.


	Speaker: annie	Listeners: group
Where is he?
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: annie
I have not seen him around all day.
	Speaker: annie	Listeners: britta
I haven't either.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: group
Well, has anyone called him?
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: jeff
I did. Several times, actually, but he never returned my calls.
	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: group
Oh, no!
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: group
Oh, the last thing I said to him was "suck it".
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: troy
Me too.
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: group
Good morning.
	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: self
Oh!
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: self
Yes!
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: self
Thank God.
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: group
You thought I was dead, didn't you?
	Speaker: group	Listeners: pierce
No...
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: pierce
I did.
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: group
You people have any idea how emasculating that is? I'm not Mickey Rooney. You don't have to cross your fingers to see if I'll show up. You know, when I was 30, people used to wish that I was dead to my face! That's called respect.


	Speaker: britta	Listeners: jeff
Who is the lucky brunette?
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: britta
Last name Beeswax, first name none-a-ya.
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: jeff
Oh, my third wife was biracial.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: britta
Stop it!
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: jeff
I am just trying to help keep you out of trouble. What if the next girl saw these?
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: britta
Well, then she would know it was hers.
	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: jeff
Jeff! You're sleeping with a woman you already slept with?
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: group
Can't I be the friend in the group whose trademark is his well-defined boundaries, like privacy smurf, discreet bear or... confidentiality spice?
	Speaker: annie	Listeners: jeff
But if you like her, why would you want to keep her a secret? Don't you want us to meet her?
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: annie
We have an agreement to keep it low-key.
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: jeff
That's ridiculous. Obviously, it's a guy.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: pierce
You're wrong, Pierce. It's two guys. Sometimes I do wish you were dead.
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: jeff
Thank you.


	Speaker: troy	Listeners: extra
What's up, bro?
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: extra
Boo!
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: extra
Hey, what's up, J-Dog?
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: extra
Woof, woof, woof, woof!
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: extra
Yeah!
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: extra
How you doing?


	Speaker: troy	Listeners: danceclass
Sorry I'm late.


	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: slater
Professor Slater, quick question.
	Speaker: slater	Listeners: jeff
You know the answer, Mr. Winger. I don't date students, even if you are no longer in my statistics class.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: slater
I'm actually kind of seeing someone right now, thank you very much.
	Speaker: slater	Listeners: jeff
Really? How's that going?
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: slater
Fine for now. She's smart and pretty. But sometimes I feel like she's just waiting for me to stop talking and take off my pants.
	Speaker: slater	Listeners: jeff
She is.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: slater
I've never been someone's dirty little secret.
	Speaker: slater	Listeners: jeff
I've never had a dirty little secret. It's so unprofessional. But the sneaking does make the sex 38% hotter.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: slater
Wow, you do like statistics, don't you?


	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: slater
Hey, midterms and whatever.
	Speaker: slater	Listeners: jeff
Chalk.
	Speaker: dean	Listeners: slater
Professor Slater, there's that transcript you wanted.
	Speaker: dean	Listeners: jeff
Jeff, I didn't expect to see you here. Hopefully, I'm not... interrupting.
	Speaker: dean	Listeners: slater jeff
You know, we laugh... but the fact is, student/teacher relationships do happen, and they are a magnet for lawsuits. So we do stay vigilant. In fact, physically attractive students and faculty are actually placed on a watch list and are ranked by their potential to incite fraternization.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: dean
You rank people by how hot they are?
	Speaker: dean	Listeners: jeff
You got it... number two.
	Speaker: slater	Listeners: dean
Dean Pelton.
	Speaker: dean	Listeners: slater
Yes, Professor Seven... Uh, Slater.
	Speaker: slater	Listeners: dean
I'll return this tomorrow.
	Speaker: dean	Listeners: slater
Okay, then.
	Speaker: dean	Listeners: slater jeff
You guys be extra careful now. Two people of your rankings in this small a room... with this type of lighting and his upper body and what her heels and hemline are doing to enhance what were already quite a few favors from God... it's all the more important to keep it tasteful.


	Speaker: slater	Listeners: jeff
I think he might have ruined...
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: slater
It's dead.


	Speaker: leclair	Listeners: all
Oh, I can't wait for the recital. You are all wonderful,
	Speaker: leclair	Listeners: troy
especially you, Troy.
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: leclair
Thank you, madame leclair.
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: all
And if any of you mention my dancing outside of class, I will break off your legs and use them to smash in your friends' cars.


	Speaker: troy	Listeners: self
Oh!
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: self
Huh!
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: self
Oh, my God!
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: self
Oh, my God!
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: troy
Troy, since when have you taken modern dance?
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: britta
Since last semester. Coach told me it would help with my coordination, and I fell in love with it, in a very straight way. I know it's tempting to sneak a peek, but I'm gonna need for you to keep your eyes up here!
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: troy
God, I should have never dismissed you as a shallow jock. Then again, we haven't really spent that much time together.
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: britta
That's because you don't play football or have fun.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: troy
I have fun tap-dancing. I started last semester too. It was always something that I wanted to do, but it was too embarrassing, so I never told anyone.
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: britta
Same here. Britta... Nobody can know about this.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: troy
Troy, who are we kidding? Look at how much time and energy we're putting into hiding something that we're passionate about. We are leading a double life.
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: britta
I am spending a lot of money on breakaway clothing.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: troy
We should look at this as an opportunity to come clean.
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: britta
Are you saying we tell the group, together?
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: troy
We could invite them to the dance recital on Friday.
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: britta
Man, I don't know. Let me think about it. Okay, let's do this.
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: britta
Ahem!
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: troy
Sorry.


	Speaker: slater	Listeners: jeff
Mr. Winger. Would you come to my office? We never finished our intercourse.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: slater
I have study group right now, and nobody uses intercourse to mean anything other than sex.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: slater
This is a wall of windows. My study group's behind it.
	Speaker: slater	Listeners: jeff
I know.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: slater
As soon as we touch, the blinds will open, and six annoying but loveable misfits will be staring at us.
	Speaker: slater	Listeners: jeff
Come on, what are the odds?
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: slater
Fine.
	Speaker: slater	Listeners: jeff
Now, was that so bad?
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: slater
Mm-mm.


	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: jeff
Hey! Could you open the back door?


	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: group
You all remember Michelle Slater, my professor from last semester? As most of you may realize by now, she's the woman I've been seeing lately.
	Speaker: slater	Listeners: jeff
Why are they looking at me like I'm a zoo animal?
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: slater
Well, Jeff acts as sort of the dad of the group, so emotionally this is kind of like being told that you're our new mom.
	Speaker: slater	Listeners: abed
But you know it's nothing like that, right?
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: slater
Absolutely. Do you cook macaroni?
	Speaker: slater	Listeners: abed
I have.
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: slater
Macaroni's my favorite.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: group
The important thing is we all understand Professor Slater and I need this to be our little secret. Everyone understand that?
	Speaker: group	Listeners: jeff
Yeah.
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: jeff
Yes. I do like macaroni.
	Speaker: group	Listeners: self
Sure.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: slater
See? All good.
	Speaker: slater	Listeners: group
Well, thank you, everyone. I appreciate it.
	Speaker: slater	Listeners: jeff
I should get going.
	Speaker: slater	Listeners: group
Bye.
	Speaker: group	Listeners: slater
Bye.


	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: jeff
Well, Jeff, you've taken a big step in knocking down the barriers between students and teachers... Just like Rosa Parks.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: pierce
I don't think it's like that.
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: jeff
No, it's just like that.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: pierce
I feel if you need to explain it, it's not just like that.


	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: britta
Is your heart gonna be okay with this?
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: shirley
I will try to find the tools to survive.
	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: britta
Okay.


	Speaker: britta	Listeners: group
Hey, everybody, speaking of secrets, Troy and I have something that we would like to announce.
	Speaker: annie	Listeners: self
Oh!
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: annie
No. No.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: group
There's a dance recital on Friday, and I would be honored if you guys would attend, because since last semester, I... have been taking a tap class.
	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: britta
That's... f... funny.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: shirley
Well, I don't know how funny it is.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: britta
Come on... we're not making fun of you. But obviously, you kept it a secret because you saw the irony too.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: jeff
Irony?
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: britta
Well, you're not a typically vulnerable or feminine person, and the act of dancing is considered both vulnerable and feminine.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: group
I disagree. What about fred Astaire? What about Baryshnikov?
	Speaker: annie	Listeners: britta
Yeah, I guess.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: britta
There are exceptions to the rule, but even when Jerry Rice went on dancing with the stars...
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: jeff
Jerry Rice? Oh, God. I liked him.
	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: troy
Troy? What... what's your secret?
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: group
Um... M... my secret... is that... I knew Britta's secret.
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: group
Yeah. I saw her in her dance outfit, and she looked ridiculous. So I helped her protect her shame. You know, I'm just glad she's out now.
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: britta
Bravo, Britta.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: troy
Thanks.


	Speaker: dean	Listeners: jeff
Mr. Winger, there you are. Just got word of your relationship with Professor Slater. I'd like to see both of you in my office in half an hour.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: group dean
What the... none of you left the room. How is that even possible?
	Speaker: dean	Listeners: jeff
Well, for one thing, it's all over Twitter.


	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: annie
Britta in a tutu... Can you imagine?


	Speaker: britta	Listeners: troy
Hey. What the hell? I thought we were supposed to come out to the group together.
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: britta
Yeah. I changed my mind.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: troy
Well, they're gonna find out that you dance at the recital.
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: britta
I'm not gonna be in the recital. I'm dropping the class.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: troy
Oh, my God. How can you do this? I'm so disappointed in you.
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: britta
Hey, you don't get to talk to me like that. You are not Shirley! And Shirley's not my mom.
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: britta
Britta, it's not like we were in the same boat. Girls are supposed to dance. That's why God gave them parts that jiggle. But I'd be going from starting quarterback to a guy that twirls around in tights. I've got way more to lose getting up on that stage because I'm a man.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: troy
Well, guess what? A real man doesn't bail on his friends or on himself. You're a dancer, Troy. It's who you are.
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: britta
Not anymore.
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: extra
Excuse me.


	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: britta
Upset about Jeff?
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: shirley
No. I am upset about... something I can't talk about.
	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: britta
We can talk about anything... politics, medicine, Jeff.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: shirley
Okay. Uh, did you hear that the shroud of turin...
	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: britta
Here's the thing about Jeff.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: shirley
Wow.
	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: britta
Chasing after you made him a better person because you always called him on his stuff. All this time, you've been warming him up and stirring in sweetener and making him just right. And, sure, you weren't ready to take a sip yet, but that didn't mean you want somebody to snatch him off the counter and guzzle him down right in front of you.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: shirley
Shirley, I did not warm Jeff up. Nobody ever will. Do you think Professor Slater is getting flowers right now? Do you think that they are gonna go to the movies and hold hands, visit her parents? No. The only thing keeping them going was the thrill of the secrecy, and now that it is out, it is over, believe me.
	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: britta
Can... can I just ask as a divorced black housewife... What part of being a single white slacker makes you people so jaded?
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: shirley
Ooh! You people? What do you mean, you people? I cannot believe I got to say that.
	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: britta
It's the little things, isn't it?


	Speaker: dean	Listeners: jeff slater
Okay, well, now that your secret is out there, I'm just gonna talk you through this teacher/student relationship form, and then we can get you two on your very attractive way.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: dean
We haven't even admitted to being a couple. In fact, this is all based on hearsay, worse than hearsay. Pierce's Twitter account, in which he says he's 47 and teaches a women's-only pilates class.
	Speaker: slater	Listeners: jeff
Jeff, it's okay. It's out. And you know what? It doesn't bother me. I'm happy.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: slater
Sweet.
	Speaker: dean	Listeners: slater jeff
Well...  First question. "How long have you been doing it?" Oh!  Not it. I mean this... dating.
	Speaker: slater	Listeners: dean
A few weeks.
	Speaker: dean	Listeners: slater jeff
Mm-hmm. And... how long have you been doing it?
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: dean
We don't have to answer that.
	Speaker: dean	Listeners: jeff slater
Oh, it... hmm? Now... this is just hypothetical. Might you ever consider spending the night with a third person?
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: dean
That's not on there!
	Speaker: dean	Listeners: jeff
Well...
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: slater
Wow, it's on there.
	Speaker: dean	Listeners: slater jeff
Just exploring your options, obviously. No agenda. I'll put "TBD". Would you describe yourself as boyfriend and girlfriend?
	Speaker: slater	Listeners: dean
Yes.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: dean
Eh...
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: slater
What?
	Speaker: dean	Listeners: self
Oh, boy.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: slater
It's semantics, really, isn't it?
	Speaker: slater	Listeners: jeff
We've slept together every night for the last three weeks. How would you describe me?
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: slater
The best friend ever.
	Speaker: dean	Listeners: self
Ooh.
	Speaker: slater	Listeners: jeff
Well, uh... I guess I've had the wrong idea about us. But you know what? This is good. I'd be better off dating, um... an adult.
	Speaker: slater	Listeners: dean
See you around.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: slater
Michelle.
	Speaker: dean	Listeners: slater
Mm. Rarr!
	Speaker: dean	Listeners: jeff
I'll get the break-up form.


	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: slater
I got freaked out by that boyfriend label. I'm... afraid of commitment.
	Speaker: slater	Listeners: jeff
How original.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: slater
Look, the biggest truths aren't original. Truth is ketchup. It's Jim Belushi. Its job isn't to blow our minds. It's to be within reach, so the truth is... I get claustrophobic when things get official.
	Speaker: slater	Listeners: jeff
You're acting like I'm a Venus flytrap. I didn't want or need more than what we were doing.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: slater
Let's get back to it. Should I get the door?
	Speaker: slater	Listeners: jeff
I can't now, because you went to the friend place. That's you getting official, not me, because unless there's something I need to know about the lunch lady or that blonde in your Spanish class with the infinite supply of leather jackets, somewhere between our 9th and 11th slumber party, statistically speaking, most people would call us more than pals.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: slater
Yeah, but soon as you say it, it can get complicated and messy.
	Speaker: slater	Listeners: jeff
How?
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: slater
Because when you say it, later on, you might have to un-say it.
	Speaker: slater	Listeners: jeff
Whoopee flippin' ding, Winger. It happens 50 million times a day. It's the Jim Belushi of sexual commitments. It barely means anything, and it grows on what's there over time.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: slater
Boy, that guy's really taking a pounding in this conversation.
	Speaker: slater	Listeners: jeff
I'll see you around, Jeff.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: slater
I really liked what we were doing. And if the ratio of work to pleasure can really stay at that same level, I don't care what it's called. I'll do it. Let's do it.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: slater
Okay.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: slater
Okay.


	Speaker: britta	Listeners: annie
Oh, that's a big crowd out there.
	Speaker: annie	Listeners: britta
Abed's really good at inviting people. We're all here to support you. Jeff even brought his girlfriend.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: annie
Oh. She's his girlfriend now? Can't wait till he hears about it.
	Speaker: annie	Listeners: britta
Oh, he knows. They even had to file paperwork with the Dean. It's pretty serious. Our little Jeff's growing up!
	Speaker: annie	Listeners: britta
Oh! Break a leg, Britta. I have no idea how someone could do what you're about to do.


	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: group
I brought goobers. Anybody want a goober? Get them while they're gooby!


	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: group
Well, this is already ridiculous.
	Speaker: group	Listeners: pierce
Shh!
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: self
Tea for two? There... there're five people.
	Speaker: group	Listeners: pierce
Shh!
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: group
Good Lord. Is she a water pot or a tea kettle?
	Speaker: group	Listeners: pierce
Shh!
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: group
Don't you think the flowers are dying from the tea?
	Speaker: group	Listeners: pierce
Shh!
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: group
Shh, shh!
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: pierce
Everyone can hear you.
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: jeff
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh!


	Speaker: leclair	Listeners: britta
Britta.
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: self
Water it!


	Speaker: annie	Listeners: abed
What's going on?
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: group
So embarrassing.
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: group
Ooh! Plot twist.
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: britta
Easy, girl. There we go.
	Speaker: leclair	Listeners: pianist
Play something modern.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: troy
What are you doing here?
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: britta
Being a friend and a man.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: self
Oh!
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: group
Culturally, it's unacceptable, but it's theatrical dynamite!
	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: britta troy
Bravo!
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: all
Yeah, all right! Bring it! Woof, woof, woof, woof! Greendale!


	Speaker: abed	Listeners: troy britta
Hi, guys. That was really cool. I wish I knew how to tap-dance.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: abed
Well, thanks, Abed. It takes a lot of hard work, but you could always take a class.
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: britta
Mm, pass.


	Speaker: britta	Listeners: troy
Hey, Troy. Thank you.
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: britta
No, thank you. I mean, you looked so pathetic, you made going up there the most masculine option.


	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: troy
Troy! What you did up there really took guts. I'm impressed.
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: pierce
Thanks, Pierce.
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: troy
Yeah. And such a creative way to tell the world you're gay.


	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: britta
Good job up there.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: jeff
Thank you. Where's your date? Didn't she want to get my autograph?
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: britta
Oh, she's getting a permission slip from the Dean to allow us to drive home together.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: jeff
I heard you guys are official now.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: britta
Yeah, I guess. You actually had a big part in that. I mean, if I can handle having a girl for a friend, who's to say I'm not ready for a girlfriend?
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: jeff
Makes perfect sense. Break a leg.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: jeff
Flowers.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: britta
Yeah. Is that... that's what people do, right? I was gonna throw them up on stage, but I thought they might catch fire.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: jeff
No, this is... this is good. You can hand them to me. Thank you.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: britta
See you Monday.

Oh, damn, you're good.
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: troy
Thank you.

I never even heard of that last one.

One of the two brother actors. Bridges. Four letters.

Hmm.
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: abed
I know. Bridges.
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: troy
I don't know.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: abed troy
Come on, guys. Can't you see the pattern there? Can you see it? It's Beau... Beau Bridges! These are all things you can see on TV... Except for Pierce... That's a misdirect.

Oh.

Hmm.

I love misdirects.

I love The Big Lebowski.

	Speaker: britta	Listeners: jeff
Missed you at lunch today. Did you slip out for a quickie with professor hot stuff?
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: britta
Her name is Michelle, and how did you know?
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: jeff
There's a gold star on your fly.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: britta
You weren't kidding.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: britta
You know, it's nice to have a girlfriend with a sense of humor and one who recognizes good work.


	Speaker: vaughan	Listeners: annie
Oh, it'll change your life. Let me teach you the chords. See, that's "g." that's the most important chord. In my mind, it... it stands for "God."
	Speaker: vaughan	Listeners: annie
But not like a bible God, because I think that God is in everything.
	Speaker: annie	Listeners: vaughan
You're complicated.
	Speaker: vaughan	Listeners: annie
* Annie * * Annie, where are you going today? *
	Speaker: annie	Listeners: vaughan
Spanish class.
	Speaker: vaughan	Listeners: annie
* Spanish *


	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: britta
Why is Annie talking to micro-nipples?
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: jeff
Vaughan? Whatever.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: britta
you know what I don't get? He never wears a shirt. He never wears shoes. Why hasn't he died from lack of service?


	Speaker: troy	Listeners: abed
You watching another movie in your dorm tonight?
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: troy
Kickpuncher, starring don "the demon" Donaldson as a cyborg cop whose punches have the power of kicks.
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: abed
That sounds awful. I'll bring the popcorn.
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: troy
Cool.
	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: abed
Uh, you... you watch bad movies on purpose?
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: shirley
Yeah. We make fun of 'em.
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: shirley
Shirley, don't embarrass yourself. I'm sure they don't want to invite a housewife.
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: shirley troy pierce
Actually, if she doesn't mind reinforcing the stereotype, I bet Shirley would have fun talking smack at a movie.
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: shirley
Care to join us?
	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: abed
Usually when a movie's bad, I stop watching, but this sounds college-y.
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: abed
What time do you want us there?
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: pierce
Pierce, you don't want to watch a cyborg movie in Abed's dorm. You want to lay on your twin bed and think about what you used to be.
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: troy abed shirley
What? You think I'm too old to make monkeyshines at a picture show? Come on. I'm younger than the three of you put together.


	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: britta
Yeah, you know, everyone talks about his nipples, but his feet freak me out.


	Speaker: annie	Listeners: britta
Britta!
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: annie
Hey.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: annie
Hi.
	Speaker: annie	Listeners: britta
Can I ask you something... About Vaughan?
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: annie
Oh, yes. I still don't know if that's his first or last name.
	Speaker: annie	Listeners: britta
He's sweet, actually. I mean, you must have thought so.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: annie
He has a sincerity I found attractive in a simpler time.
	Speaker: annie	Listeners: britta
Would you... um, I haven't... we haven't... anything. I mean...
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: annie
wow, you and Vaughan.
	Speaker: annie	Listeners: britta
Would it bug you?
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: annie
Well, what about you and Troy?
	Speaker: annie	Listeners: britta
Troy... The other day after Spanish, I thought he was trying to hold my hand, but he'd just mistaken me for abed. He'll never think of me that way.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: annie
Well, Annie, I would have to be a villain to tell you who to date, which I am not.
	Speaker: annie	Listeners: britta
Britta! Thank you. You're the coolest girl I've ever met.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: annie
Damn right. Give me some fivesies. Whoo. Turning it into a snake.
	Speaker: annie	Listeners: britta
Cool.


	Speaker: britta	Listeners: jeff
hey. How's it going? Did you hear? It's cute... Annie and Vaughan.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: britta
Get to the cute part.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: jeff
She's into him. She asked for my blessing.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: britta
And you gave it?
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: jeff
Yeah. I'm done with him.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: britta
Look, this isn't about you, you groovy hipster. It's about Annie. We're like her Greendale parents. You got to say no to that stuff.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: jeff
He's not that bad.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: britta
Yeah, not if you're 28 and you're fooling around with him. She's 18. Her taste in men is still being established. Creepier and creepier dudes will start thinking of her as an option, and it all starts with Vaughan. He's a gateway douche bag.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: jeff
People collide. Things happen. It can't be controlled, right?
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: britta
And that can be your toast at her shotgun wedding to starburns.


	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: britta starburns
Oh, yeah, turn to your left. Oh, now turn to your right. Yes, we can see both of them. It's like a constellation on your face.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: starburns
Oh, what's up, dude? Yeah.
	Speaker: starburns	Listeners: extra
That guy over there, he's a douche bag.


	Speaker: abed	Listeners: troy shirley
Hey, guys.
	Speaker: chang	Listeners: troy shirley
hola.
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: shirley troy
Hey, I hope you don't mind. I invited senor Chang. We're Netflix friends.
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: chang
Oh, that's cool that you're hanging out, drinking beers with your students.
	Speaker: chang	Listeners: troy
Yeah. Clearly, none of my other plans fell through.


	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: all
Let's get to the movie.
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: shirley
Oh, I'm sorry, Shirley. I'll wait if you want to serve beverages.
	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: pierce
You gonna be waiting a long-ass time.


	Speaker: troy	Listeners: movie
Ooh, FBI warning... I'm so scared.
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: all
Hey, that's not fair. I didn't know we started.
	Speaker: movie	Listeners: self
It is the year 2006 AD, and nuclear war has ravaged the planet.
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: movie
I must have missed that.
	Speaker: chang	Listeners: abed
Nice.
	Speaker: movie	Listeners: self
The wasteland between cities is a free-fire zone ruled by scavengers, drug dealers, and terrorists.
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: movie
Sounds like a Thanksgiving at my house.
	Speaker: chang	Listeners: troy
That's pretty crazy.
	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: all
He did it, though.
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: all
They just come to me.
	Speaker: movie	Listeners: self
You guys want to buy some mega dope? It gets you mega High.
	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: movie
Will it get me through this movie?
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: all
Shirley in the house.
	Speaker: movie	Listeners: self
Freeze! Police.
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: movie
Freeze police? Don't do that. They'll get cold.
	Speaker: movie	Listeners: self
You have done so much for our city. Kickpuncher, is there anything that we can give you?
	Speaker: chang	Listeners: movie
Yeah, two hours of my life back.
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: chang
Nice.
	Speaker: movie	Listeners: self
Don't call me kickpuncher. Call me David.
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: movie
"Directed by Kim Yang." Asian... Can't direct, can't drive.
	Speaker: chang	Listeners: pierce
Dude, I'm right here.


	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: all
So... Clearly we're all a bunch of funny people. When are we doing this again?
	Speaker: all	Listeners: pierce
Well, actually, tomorrow we were all gonna get together--
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: pierce
Tomorrow night we're all gonna get together to watch kickpuncher 2: Codename Punchkicker.
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: all
Well, I was just warming up tonight. Tomorrow you better foam the runways, 'cause I'm bringing my "a" game.
	Speaker: chang	Listeners: self
Awesome.


	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: britta
Oh, my God. He's got her in some kind of hippie collar. I can hear her armpit hair growing from here. We got to do something.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: jeff
Okay, even if I agreed with you, what are we gonna do?
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: britta
Well, I know if we say we disapprove, we'll just drive her further into his hemp-braceleted arms. We need to be smart. We need to hatch a scheme.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: jeff
Mm, hatching schemes is not really my wheelhouse.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: britta
Let's not confine ourselves to your wheelhouse. This problem won't respond to tap dancing or casual revelations that you spent time in new York.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: jeff
Okay, if you're gonna get all upper East side about this, I think we're done.
	Speaker: starburns	Listeners: jeff
Hey, winger, check out Annie. Somebody just went to the top of my "to do" list.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: jeff
Okay, we need to hatch a scheme.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: britta
Thank you.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: britta
It's all very simple. In Annie's world, long before Vaughan, she only had eyes for Troy.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: jeff
So if Troy becomes a real option, Annie will drop Vaughan in a hippie's heartbeat.


	Speaker: vaughan	Listeners: annie
That's nice.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: britta
Crash course in manipulation... you don't actually tell the person what you want them to do. You help them realize they want to do it so it can't be traced back to you.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: troy
Chemistry... sexy. You know what else is sexy? Annie.
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: britta
I know chemistry is sexy. But Annie? I don't see it.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: troy
Well, every other guy on campus does.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: troy
You really don't see how pretty Annie is?
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: britta jeff
Maybe it's 'cause I knew her back in High school, before she dropped out. She had braces and acne and a pill addiction and a nervous breakdown ending with her running through a plate-glass door, screaming, "everyone's a robot!"
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: troy
I see what's happening here. Troy, I want you to clear your head.
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: jeff
Done.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: troy
I'm gonna describe to you a complete stranger who happens to be in our study group.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: britta
Would you excuse us for a moment?
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: jeff
Annie?
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: jeff
No kidding.
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: jeff
Come on, you got to be exaggerating.
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: jeff
Oh, man.
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: jeff
And she's Jewish?
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: jeff britta
I can't believe I didn't see that. Well, I guess she deserves another shot. Oh, wait, never mind. It's too late. I Heard she's hooking up with Vaughan.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: troy
Only to make you jealous.
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: britta
What?
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: britta
What?
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: troy
She's helplessly in love with you. She's only with Vaughan to get your attention. And you have to give it to her now.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: jeff
Right, Jeff?
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: britta
Sure.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: troy
But the point is, we're not telling you what to do.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: troy
Oh, yeah, you didn't hear it from us.
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: self
I have the weirdest boner.


	Speaker: movie	Listeners: self
I saw you die. How can you be alive?
	Speaker: movie	Listeners: self
I guess it's just a bad day for drug-dealing terrorists and a good day for... Kickpuncher.
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: comedyclub
All right, guys, you hear that pause right after he says, "and a good day"? What do you got for me there?
	Speaker: comedyclub	Listeners: pierce
And a good day for a nutritious breakfast.
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: comedyclub
I don't get it.
	Speaker: comedyclub	Listeners: pierce
It's a good day for a terrible movie.
	Speaker: comedyclub	Listeners: pierce
A good day for hair products.
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: comedyclub
Oh, buzz, how many times can you keep going to that well?
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: comedyclub
Come on, guys. I'm starting to wonder if you even deserve to call yourselves a community college sketch comedy troupe. I told you, on movie night, I need to blow these punks out of the water. I need Phyllis Diller-grade stuff.
	Speaker: comedyclub	Listeners: pierce
Wouldn't you rather just watch a movie with your friends and have a good time?
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: comedyclub
What are you, my third wife's therapist?
	Speaker: comedyclub	Listeners: pierce
What if he said, "it's a good day for..." And you said, "for being gay"?
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: comedyclub
You're a genius.
	Speaker: comedyclub	Listeners: self
He likes gay jokes.
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: comedyclub
What?
	Speaker: comedyclub	Listeners: pierce
I said we write great jokes.
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: comedyclub
Don't flatter yourselves.


	Speaker: troy	Listeners: self
Whoa.
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: annie
Hey... Annie. It's me, Troy.
	Speaker: annie	Listeners: troy
Oh, I don't know where abed is. I could try calling him if you want.
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: annie
Nah, I'm not looking for my other half. I'm looking for you, girl.
	Speaker: annie	Listeners: self
Oh.
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: annie
Yeah.	 Let that sink in for a second. You know, I never noticed how... Beautiful you are.
	Speaker: annie	Listeners: troy
Troy, you're being weird.
	Speaker: vaughan	Listeners: annie
Sorry it took me so long. They made me find a shirt.
	Speaker: annie	Listeners: vaughan
Vaughan, you remember Troy. Um, we went to High school together, and he's in my study group.
	Speaker: vaughan	Listeners: troy
Hey, what's up, man? Hi, bro.
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: vaughan
I'm not your bro... Bro.
	Speaker: vaughan	Listeners: troy
Oh, actually, everyone is my bro in the whole entire universe, you know, because everything's connected... rocks, eagles, hats.
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: vaughan
Yeah, well some things are more connected than others, like tarantulas and me peeing my pants... Or me and Annie.
	Speaker: annie	Listeners: troy
What? Wait. Troy, what?
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: annie
Tell him. Tell him that you've been in love with me since High school.
	Speaker: vaughan	Listeners: annie
What? Wait a minute. Is that true, mountain flower?
	Speaker: annie	Listeners: vaughan
No. I mean... I never want to lie to you, so I will tell you I did have feelings for him, but it's over, I swear.
	Speaker: vaughan	Listeners: annie
You're swearing? Like Britta swore that she didn't like Jeff and then gave him a copy of my poem so he could laugh at me with that Sherri Shepherd Lady? Oh, it's happening again. Your study group is evil. And you don't deserve ice cream.
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: annie
Well, he's a baby. Now, where were we?
	Speaker: annie	Listeners: troy
I like him. Why would you do that?
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: annie
Come on. Everybody knows you want a cut of the t-bone steak. Jeff and Britta told me how you feel.
	Speaker: annie	Listeners: troy
Wait, Jeff and Britta did what, now?
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: annie
Oh, you're even hotter when you're angry. Let's do this.
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: annie
Red shoe diaries... I think you know I have a thing for butt stuff.


	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: britta
To Annie's inevitable breakup with Grodie j. McConaughey.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: jeff
And to her and Troy. We did the right thing. They belong together. Plus, their babies will be so cute.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: britta
Why would you say that?
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: jeff
Come on. You know that babies are extra cute when their parents are...
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: britta
Both cute?
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: jeff
Do you want kids?
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: britta
We'll see. Put on something nice, and find me after lunch.


	Speaker: annie	Listeners: jeff britta
Hey, guys, thanks for getting involved in my love life. That was super cool and mature of you. Oh, and since you're both clearly idiots, I should probably let you know that I'm being sarcastic.
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: jeff britta
Hey, guys, thanks for taking ugly Annie out of the palm of my hand and turning her into yet another hottie that will never get with me!
	Speaker: leonard	Listeners: jeff britta
Hey, guys, thanks for eating all the macaroni!
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: leonard
Shut up, Leonard. Nobody even knows what you're talking about.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: jeff
I did eat all the macaroni. It's messed up that he knows.


	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: all
let's light this candle. Who's ready for some kickpunching?
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: pierce
Actually, we decided to watch runaway instead. Tom selleck fights mechanical spiders.
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: abed
What? No, no, you can't do that. We just watched kickpuncher. We have to see kickpuncher 2. I have so many unanswered questions.
	Speaker: chang	Listeners: pierce
No, I want to watch tom Selleck fight mechanical spiders.
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: chang
Yes.
	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: chang
Me too.
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: all
My brother died on the set of that movie. One of the mechanical spiders just went haywire and tore him to pieces. Tom Selleck just stood there. He just stood there and... and watched him die.
	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: all
Okay, then let... let's watch kickpuncher 2, then.
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: all
Yeah. Okay.
	Speaker: chang	Listeners: pierce
I'm sorry for your loss, man.
	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: pierce
I'm sorry, Pierce.
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: pierce
Yeah, that's messed up, dude.
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: all
kickpuncher 2.
	Speaker: movie	Listeners: self
My punches were only as strong as my punches, and then things changed.
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: movie
Change? Time to change the channel. This guy's gonna be begging for change, he keeps making movies this bad. They should change this movie to something good. I wish this crap-apillar would change into a butterfly and fly away. That's change we can believe in.
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: pierce
Okay, obviously something strange is happening here.
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: abed
What do you mean? I'm making jokes during the movie.
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: pierce
Yeah, but you're doing it with the speed and the determination of the incomparable Robin Williams.
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: pierce
Yeah.
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: abed troy
Maybe I'm just that brilliant.
	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: pierce
I think you came prepared.
	Speaker: chang	Listeners: pierce
Dude, even I know you're lame, and I'm a tenured professor sitting in a beanbag chair.
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: chang
You're not a professor.
	Speaker: chang	Listeners: troy
Shut up, man.
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: all
Fine! You got me. I did a little advance work. Pathetic? No, I'll tell you what's pathetic... you all sitting there making fun of other people's work. You don't feel good about yourselves, so you have to tear down everything around you. What's the matter? Mama Chang didn't breast-feed?
	Speaker: chang	Listeners: pierce
She read in a book that it wouldn't make a difference.
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: all
You all sicken me! And I will no longer participate in your destructive, negative behavior.
	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: pierce
Pierce, that was deep and total BS
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: pierce
Yeah, this isn't about us. This is just a deflection because you can't get a genuine laugh.
	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: pierce
Mm-hmm.
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: abed
That in itself is a laugh. I know I'm funny. I don't need any of you people to validate me.
	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: self
Mm.
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: self
Mm.


	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: self
Oh! Oh!
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: all
Biggest laugh of the night.


	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: group
Then I was gonna say, "it's a good day to be gay."


	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: annie
Annie... We're sorry. We were worried about your well-being.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: annie
I guess we feel like we're sort of all a family, and Jeff and I are like your Greendale parents.
	Speaker: annie	Listeners: britta
You're not my mom, Britta. She would never wear boots that go up that High. And what about respecting me as an adult and as a friend?
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: annie
Oh, you want to be treated as an adult and a friend? Try not dating your friend's ex-boyfriend. Find your own man.
	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: self
Oh, my.
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: self
Oh, boy.
	Speaker: annie	Listeners: britta
But you don't like Vaughan.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: annie
No, I don't, but I also don't like seeing him with anyone else. Ta-da!
	Speaker: annie	Listeners: britta
I asked you if you cared, and you said no.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: annie
Fine. I cared. I'm a girlie-girl. I like boys, and I don't like it when they're mean to me, and I don't like it when they stop kissing me and start kissing my friends. I'm not that cool. I'm not Juno, okay, homeslice?
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: britta
This is what it was about for you? You were jealous?
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: jeff
Oh, please, you can't tell me that you weren't jealous that Vaughan had his hippie hands all over your debate/make-out partner.
	Speaker: annie	Listeners: britta
What are you insinuating? I took that kiss for the team.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: annie
What?
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: britta
Yeah, that kiss wasn't for pleasure. It was strategic and joyless.
	Speaker: annie	Listeners: jeff
What?
	Speaker: annie	Listeners: britta
Yeah.
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: jeff
You did get weirdly specific when you were describing Annie's body.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: troy
More specific than the stuff you told me about Britta?
	Speaker: annie	Listeners: troy
What?
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: troy
What?
	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: group
Does anyone get specific about me?
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: shirley
Check your email.
	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: pierce
I'll mark you as spam.
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: shirley
Who the hell is Pam?
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: group
When you guys first came in, we were as wholesome and healthy as the family in the Brady bunch. And now we're as dysfunctional and incestuous as the cast of the Brady bunch.
	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: group
I agree with abed. This is getting creepy.
	Speaker: annie	Listeners: shirley
No more creepy than when Jeff wears tight jeans and you say, "I'd like to slap those buns on the grill."
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: annie
What?
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: annie
What?
	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: annie
First of all, I don't talk like that, and second of all, where I'm from, it's perfectly normal for women to talk about their male friends' backsides. And you don't see me saying anything crazy about abed and Troy's weird little relationship.
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: troy
They're just jealous.
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: abed
They're just jealous.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: group
All right, all right, maybe we're not a family. Maybe it's more complicated, because unlike a real family, there's nothing to stop any one of us from looking at any of the others as a sexual prospect.
	Speaker: annie	Listeners: group
Why are we even talking about this?
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: annie
Because you started having sex with Britta's ex-boyfriend.
	Speaker: annie	Listeners: jeff
What? We haven't even kissed.
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: annie
That doesn't mean you're not having sex.
	Speaker: annie	Listeners: group
Vaughan told me he would take things as slowly as I wanted. He likes me for who I am, and I like him.


	Speaker: abed	Listeners: group
Do you guys hear that?
	Speaker: vaughan	Listeners: annie
Annie.
	Speaker: annie	Listeners: vaughan
Vaughan.
	Speaker: vaughan	Listeners: britta
Britta.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: vaughan
Hi.
	Speaker: vaughan	Listeners: pierce
Old man river.
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: vaughan
Eat me.
	Speaker: annie	Listeners: vaughan
Did you get my messages?
	Speaker: vaughan	Listeners: annie
No. I threw my phone into the river. I thought that, you know, if I can't be with her, who am I gonna call? And then I thought, you know, well, my landlord, my sister, and... You. Anyway, I've been doing a lot of soul-searching,
	Speaker: vaughan	Listeners: annie
and, uh, this is something I really need to say. * * * I see you when you smile * * and I want to sing a song * * but then I write the words * * and they always come out wrong * * they come out wrong * * I feel it in my fingers * * I feel it in my toes * * but then the words get frozen * * in my mouth like Eskimos * * I like your nose * * ooh ooh ooh * * ooh * * Annie * * ooh ooh ooh * * ooh * * Annie's song *
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: group
his songs are dumber than he is.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: pierce
Yeah, but they're honest.
	Speaker: annie	Listeners: britta
Okay. Vaughan wants to show me a cloud that looks like a Pumpkin... If that's okay.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: annie
Annie, it's more than okay. Please date Vaughan.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: annie
Or anyone else outside this creepy circle.
	Speaker: annie	Listeners: group
I wouldn't hang out with you guys if you were creepy. Trust me. I have good taste.
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: group
So just to be clear, I don't have a shot with any of you?


	Speaker: troy	Listeners: abed
I am kickpuncher. My cyber punch have the power of kicks.
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: self
Agh!
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: self
Aha. Oh!
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: self
Oh!
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: troy
I am Punchkicker. Meet your match.
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: troy
I love you, kickpuncher.
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: abed
The only thing beyond the reach of my fists is humanity.
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: abed
You're sure Britta couldn't do your part?
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: troy
I asked her. She wasn't available. Let's go film the sex scene.

		all right, i am convening this disciplinary tribunal At our state-of-the-art judge's table, Which has its own built-in sound system, So take that yale. Our judges include myself, uh, dean craig pelton.

		well, it certainly--

		Well, it certainly sounds to me That this young lady's only crime Is being a hero and wanting to be taller. This tribunal is adjourned.

		and we're back.

		no, no. there's nothing In the bylaws about recesses, all right? The wheels of justice here don't stop Just because you--aah! Time out! time out! Save the table! save the table!

		One, two, luis guzman! oh! oh, oh! You know, greendale may never be harvard

		i'd like to introduce our student, pierce hawthorne, Who's written greendale its own school song.

		Why is Urkel ripping the antenna off professor Slater's car?

		good morning, greendale! Just a reminder, Our debate team will bring home The championship tomorrow versus city college. Go, human beings!

		whoo! And now, from city college, Jeremy simmons.

		uh, yep. they reserved it. Okay, they've got us by the short ones. The debate is suspended until tomorrow.

		Okay, you can hear this? okay. Good morning. I'm here to kick off the first day of new tradition At our school called "green week."

		all this week, greendale college Is becoming so earth-smart That we're changing our name to envirodale!

		Well, there's, um, also going to be A free rock and roll concert By a certain band called green day. Huh? that make you happy?

		whoo! whoo! whoo! okay, thank you. Green week was a rousing success Here at greendale. And now for our band, greene daeye! By the way, they're not the real green day. Thought we should just rip that band-aid off quickly. Okay!

		Oh, okay, the "p" word has entered into play. That's exactly why I wanted Gail, our school counselor, here, and Monique, who's keeping record, to ensure we discuss these sensitive topics in a legally appropriate manner.

		Happy last day before winter break, Greendale! Time to visit our loved ones. Some of you will travel as far as three Miles! Don't forget to visit our winter wonderland in the quad, where we're giving away catalogues of next semester's classes. Whoa, what's that sound? Is that the tippy-tapping of secular boots on the roof? Oh, well, it must be yet another sign that it 'tis the season, because rumor has it that non-denominational Mr. Winter is on his way to the student lounge!

		Ha ha ha! Merry happy!

		Guys, meet your new editor! Mr. Winger is very excited to help you bring a voice Back to the campus.

		Okay. You guys knock yourselves out!

	dean

		okay.

	jeff

		there is an olympic-sized pool there, yes,

		oh, okay, ouch, and yes. If you'd like, you may represent her. Dean you later.

		well, it sounds like there are two biases, One on each side, and i go both ways. Oh, let's strike that.

		I am impartial, so it should all work out. Okay. let's begin.

		ha. that's very funny.

		uh, absolutely.

		mm-hmm.

		oh, well. you're a very photogenic man. is that real bed head, or do you put something in there? can i? oh, it's crispy.

		you know, i did think those were less than personable, which is why i went with the full bodies in these mailers we have going out.

		jeffrey, did you not read the release agreement on the back of your registration form? i'm starting to see why someone used to be a lawyer. ha ha! up top!

		oh. goodness. look what we have stumbled onto-- an opportunity to help each other out. i suppose i wouldn't need this promotional campaign if i could announce to the press that troy barnes is playing football here.

		i think if you said, "jump," he'd say, "how high?" if you said, "stop," he'd say, "hammertime." you starting to get what i mean?

		you know, i didn't... realize before, but we should send those out to local businesses. hmm? law firms. lawyer... companies? legal... gatherings?

		i think so.

		yeah. yeah. we are developing the perfect mascot. no stereotypical identifiers from any race or gender.

		that is our human color wheel. it goes from seal to seal's teeth. what do you think?

		yes!

		no. i won't mail these out, but they are staying with me until the press announces that troy is a part of the team. and i want him at that pep rally tonight. reporters are gonna be there. we're gonna unveil the new mascot. and things are finally going to start turning around. oh, and...my ex-therapist is gonna think twice before he makes fun of my job!

		he can't move his mouth either. but take it from me, that's human for "hello."

		oh, mr. winger... Mr. winger, did you happen to hear My announcement this morning?

		i'm gonna assume that's sarcasm.

		so you didn't hear my announcement?

		oh.

		come on, jeff. I mean, who better than a former lawyer To really stick it to those city college snobs And their star debater Simmons?

		okay. no, no. Okay, wait. wait. okay, no, no. look. Listen, jerkwad-- i'm sorry. That got heated. Greendale needs a win. The best compliment our sports program gets Is that our basketball team is really gay, So what's it gonna take? You know, a plum parking space, Free meals, A night of companionship if you know what i mean.

		Hopefully, by then, we can get our act together.

		i just checked with the judges. They'll need a miracle to win in rebuttal. Simmons is finished.

		Oh, Sabrina is my new secretary.

		Isn't it great? Greendale is the latest campus to catch a case of public health fever!

		Uh, yes on single. She likes hip-hop and horses. Dislikes beards and... yeah, I was done talking.

		Ha ha! It was me. Sorry about the ruse, but I have something better Than exfoliating soap to rub on you. An opportunity. Mm. As you can see, I am resurrecting The greendale gazette journal mirror! And we need a student editor. Someone with real world savvy That extends beyond how to huff the ink.

		This would be your office.

		And you get an english credit.

		Jeffrey, I am the least racist person in the world. My best friend when I was six years old was a black man. Look, I've learned my lesson. I've got unlimited texting now. But if she runs that story, I will lose this job. And this job is my life. She listens to you.

		You do what you think is right.

		Jeff, I didn't expect to see you here. Hopefully, I'm not... interrupting.

		You know, we laugh... but the fact is, student/teacher relationships do happen, and they are a magnet for lawsuits. So we do stay vigilant. In fact, physically attractive students and faculty are actually placed on a watch list and are ranked by their potential to incite fraternization.

		You got it... number two.

		You guys be extra careful now. Two people of your rankings in this small a room... with this type of lighting and his upper body and what her heels and hemline are doing to enhance what were already quite a few favors from God... it's all the more important to keep it tasteful.

		Mr. Winger, there you are. Just got word of your relationship with Professor Slater. I'd like to see both of you in my office in half an hour.

		Well, for one thing, it's all over Twitter.

		Okay, well, now that your secret is out there, I'm just gonna talk you through this teacher/student relationship form, and then we can get you two on your very attractive way.

		Well...  First question. "How long have you been doing it?" Oh!  Not it. I mean this... dating.

		Mm-hmm. And... how long have you been doing it?

		Oh, it... hmm? Now... this is just hypothetical. Might you ever consider spending the night with a third person?

		Well...

		Just exploring your options, obviously. No agenda. I'll put "TBD". Would you describe yourself as boyfriend and girlfriend?

		I'll get the break-up form.

	greenedaeye

		oh, wow. Okay, what's this about, now?

	troy

		troy, did you know that greendale has a football team?

		troy, i was so sorry to hear about your injury. but now that you have recovered, we would love for you to play for the human beings.

		troy, all of your friends are lining up to turn greendale around. how about you?

		bros before hoes, troy.

		all right, well, uh... if you change your mind, the field is always open. oh, figuratively speaking. you know, wednesdays and sundays it's used as parking overflow for the mega-church. okay.

		Troy! Troy, all the condoms are faulty. As the best athlete on campus, I need you to run to my office and make an announcement before everyone leaves.

	slater

		Professor Slater, there's that transcript you wanted.

		You know, we laugh... but the fact is, student/teacher relationships do happen, and they are a magnet for lawsuits. So we do stay vigilant. In fact, physically attractive students and faculty are actually placed on a watch list and are ranked by their potential to incite fraternization.

		Yes, Professor Seven... Uh, Slater.

		Okay, then.

		You guys be extra careful now. Two people of your rankings in this small a room... with this type of lighting and his upper body and what her heels and hemline are doing to enhance what were already quite a few favors from God... it's all the more important to keep it tasteful.

		Okay, well, now that your secret is out there, I'm just gonna talk you through this teacher/student relationship form, and then we can get you two on your very attractive way.

		Well...  First question. "How long have you been doing it?" Oh!  Not it. I mean this... dating.

		Mm-hmm. And... how long have you been doing it?

		Oh, it... hmm? Now... this is just hypothetical. Might you ever consider spending the night with a third person?

		Just exploring your options, obviously. No agenda. I'll put "TBD". Would you describe yourself as boyfriend and girlfriend?

		Mm. Rarr!

	britta

		well, we're not gonna buy you an ice cream. Hi. dean pelton. What an entrance i got to make there. You would be Britta perry. I just spoke with senor chang, And i'm afraid greendale takes this kinda thing Very seriously.

		Your case will be reviewed By a disciplinary tribunal tomorrow In borchart hall. You could be facing expulsion.

		now, are those the high-heel boots He was talking about?

		are they comfortable?

		i'm just curious. they're cute.

		Isn't it great? Greendale is the latest campus to catch a case of public health fever!

		Because they keep getting stolen.

		Okay, I'm just gonna turn him around, and we're gonna cover him up. Okay, ladies, I am shocked at the reverse porky's that has happened here tonight.

		Now, why did you break in to see the penis?

	group

		hi, everybody. well, look at this group having some kind of meeting and being so diverse. there is just--boy! there is just one of every kind of you, isn't there?

		it's all right. don't let me interrupt. sometimes i just roll around campus like a little football. i can't believe this. here i am in a random conversation about football, and i'm talking to troy barnes, star quarterback from riverside high...whoa.

	duncan

		aye.

	self

		Good morning. How do we turn this off?  Mother, you think you can come and help me turn it off? How do we turn this off? Can you help me with this? Oh, thank you, thank you so much. I didn't mean to snap. uh, good morning. Many of you are halfway through your first week here at greendale and as your dean, i thought i would share a few thoughts of wisdom and inspiration. What is community college? Well, you've heard all kinds of things. You've heard it's "loser college for remedial teens, 20-something dropouts, middle-age divorcees, and old people keeping their minds active as they circle the drain of eternity." That's what you heard. However, i wish you luck! Okay, you know-- uh-oh. Okay, there's more to this speech. There's actually a middle card that is missing. Can we all look around our immediate areas, 'cause i really wanted to--

		Good afternoon, Greendale community college. I am your dean with a few corrections to the fall class catalog. Cosmology should be cosmetology, astrology should be astronomy, and the students on the cover should be smiling, but I suppose that's a matter of opinion. Whoever is growing a small patch of cannabis behind the gymnasium, congratulations. You have won a cruise. Report to security to claim your tickets. In order to increase awareness of homelessness, security has been given binoculars. In campus news, the debate over our library's PA system continues with some students suggesting its volume be lowered, while others question its very purpose. More on that story as it unfolds.

		good morning, greendale community college. This is your dean reminding you That among your school's prestigious alumni Is mr. luis guzman, celebrated actor And model puerto-rican american. This friday, we will be dedicating a statue of guzman And unveiling our brand-new school song. So boy, i don't know about you, But this sure feels like a real college to me.

		oh.

		oh. I hate this guy.

		whoo!

		hmm. this better not awaken anything in me.

		oh.

		I had no idea alcohol would make people horny. Makes me sleepy. I don't...

		Oh, man!

		Unh!

		No, that-- that was a good cover.

		Oh, boy.

		Ooh.

	extra

		Lashonda, can we please strike that?

		Step right up. Get a prize, not an STD. Oh, no, syphilis. Please, please, no, syphilis. Ow, it burns! Oh, that's gonna hurt.

	humanbeing

		let's get you into the pep rally!

		you did great in there!

	assistant

		okay, we need to redo these.

		well, print 5,000 more. I'm trying to save the planet, here.

	phone

		Aw... Hello? Um... wrong number.

	simmons

		eat that, simmons.

	gail

		Wow, I really do feel more comfortable saying that now, Gail.

	shirley

		yeah. my idea. it was the greendale grizzlies, but i thought that, um... well, a lot of these students have been called animals their whole lives. unfortunately, i don't know what to do about the mascot.

		Okay, I'm just gonna turn him around, and we're gonna cover him up. Okay, ladies, I am shocked at the reverse porky's that has happened here tonight.

		Now, why did you break in to see the penis?

	security

		Yeah.

		A 597? There's a dog-fighting ring in my office?

	pierce

		Pierce, okay.

		well, aren't you found money

		thanks for offering to help design the new mascot. i, uh, have been a little stumped.

		oh, i think it's-- oh. okay. it...looks a lot like you. um, here's the thing. if we are the human beings, you know, and we have a mascot that's just a white guy, what message are we sending? our symbol needs to reflect the diversity of our school and our species.

		no. no, because we're not the greendale blacks, mr. hawthorne, or the greendale asians or any other creed. we are the greendale human beings.

		excuse me.

		yeah, you're right. that beige is a little light.

		whoa, whoa, whoa-- what happened to the prototype?

		ooh. ow.

		oh, yeah, a desmond tutu with just enough cream to make it a lou diamond phillips.

		uh, let's do something for little people. ooh! or albinos!

	whitman

		okay.

	abed

		For the love of God, run!

	annie

		whoa! yoko ono much?

		he can't move his mouth either. but take it from me, that's human for "hello."

		i just checked with the judges. They'll need a miracle to win in rebuttal. Simmons is finished.

		A laser! Well, this isn't gonna be your mother's sexually transmitted disease awareness fair. You've been quite the little helper, Annie.

		Ah... You hear that, Annie? That's the sound of STDs screaming, "No! Stop being so aware of us!" Aah! And it's all thanks to you.

		Well, in recognition of all your hard work, I have decided that you should conduct the condom demonstration. You're gonna be center stage showing everyone how to put a condom on a, well, what my dad called a Jimmy Carter.

		Don't worry, not a real one. No, it's an anatomically correct model, you know. But trust me, eyes closed, you can't tell the difference. Okay.

		Okay, I'm just gonna turn him around, and we're gonna cover him up. Okay, ladies, I am shocked at the reverse porky's that has happened here tonight.

		Now, why did you break in to see the penis?

		I am not racist! I had 20 minutes to let people know That toni braxton was starting early And 273 text messages left before my rate tripled. Racial profiling may not be right, But it can be economical.

		I prefer "incompetent," but what I really want--

		Okay.

	chang

		Is this the best safe sex fair or what? Check out these condoms. All along the side it says "Greendale"! Exclamation point, my idea.

		Shut up, Ben!

	secretary

		Sabrina, take a note. I want hidden cameras in every stall.



Speaker: shirleyactor

	jeffactor

		we know you're living out of your car. Why, on lord's good earth, Are you living out of your car, boy?



Speaker: jeff

	all

		Hey, everybody. good morning. Good morning, sir. Good morning, greendale! hi! good morning! Watch the kite. uh-oh. Mind if i get a chance? oh! Look at this. one foot. Thanks, you guys. bring it in here. Nice. thank you so much, you guys. That was really fun.

		objection. i don't know what he means.

		the defense calls Britta perry.

		objection. my client did not cheat.

		yes, she did... But why? That's the real question, isn't it? The world wasn't the only thing that changed On september 11th.

		five-minute recess?

		Gentlemen... My client is insane.

		gentlemen, i'm sure you suspected... That ms. perry was pretty odd before the recess. But if you could've heard all the stuff She just told me in the shower, You would realize she is all the way out Of her entire damn mind. She doesn't want to succeed Because she doesn't think she can. So she goes out of her way to fail. That's crazy! But... Do we really want to make it a crime To be crazy at greendale? I mean, look at us. I mean, you two are arguing about status at a college That correspondence schools make fun of. Dean, you want so bad for this place to be ivy league That you are putting us at risk of electrocution. Everyone on this campus is nuts.

		if you want to rehabilitate your fellow inmate, you need to sentence her to staying here with us. Because if crazy people can't be at greendale, Where are we supposed to go?

	dean

		isn't borchart hall the pool?

		uh, is she allowed to have counsel? I mean, i may not be a practicing lawyer anymore, But relative to this place, i'm alan dershowitz.

		How can senor chang be one of the judges? He's the one accusing my client.

		dean pelton, i move this case Be thrown out of... The pool area!

		dean, i'm sure troy will sign up for football if and when some accident damages the part of his brain that feels pride. until then, would you excuse us?

		sorry to disturb you guys... who are clearly looking at a naked drawing of pierce doing jumping jacks.

		dean, a quick download, please?

		first of all...

		i'm flattered.

		i was thinking about the four disembodied heads, and i thought, where's the heart? where's the soul? where's the different poster design?

		mailers? i didn't give permission for this.

		if someone from the outside were to find-- okay, if someone from the outside were to find out that i am a student at a community college, that could have a negative impact on my future career.

		i think he's been pretty clear about declining that offer.

		no. i need another example.

		are you trying to blackmail me?

		wow.

		is that seal?

		i think not being racist is the new racism.

		so...troy is gonna play football.

		which means i'll be getting rid of these.

		i hang on every word.

		correct.

		i'm barely listening now.

		mm, pass.

		i'll do it for the parking space. And if you promise not to tell me what you mean.

		Gross. Dean, your assistant. Is she single? What are her likes and dislikes?

		Actually, dean, I'm resolved to spend this semester Being more...

		Relaxed...And awesome. This is the first desk I've seen in six months That doesn't have "zeppelin rules" carved into it.

		Well, that ain't bad neither. I'm in.

		Well, next time we're both hanging out having fun I could try cracking wise about it with her.

		You rank people by how hot they are?

		What the... none of you left the room. How is that even possible?

		We haven't even admitted to being a couple. In fact, this is all based on hearsay, worse than hearsay. Pierce's Twitter account, in which he says he's 47 and teaches a women's-only pilates class.

		We don't have to answer that.

		That's not on there!

		Eh...

	extra

		Shouldn't be too hard to fake a study group, right? Oh, geez, I'm sorry, I, I was raised on TV and I was conditioned to believe that every, Black woman over 50 is a cosmic mentor,

		Yes, I'm so sorry. It's Seinfeld.

		hey, man. my name's Jeff. I'm trying to lock down the rest of my schedule Before the deadline. I heard this class was a cakewalk. Are you passing it? Do you like dane cook?

		so far so good.

		Beat it.

		Small coffee, please.

		85--go long!

		nice catch!

		Look, I really need to liquidate some assets. It's an emergency situation. What kind of an offer is that? These are mint condition issues. The premise alone is priceless. The guy has the powers and strength of a spider. No, your incredulity perplexes me, nerd.

		Has this always been here?

		Hey, it's Jeff Winger. Well, I wanted to see what you were doing tonight. What do you mean, do I know your name? What kind of a question is that? Of course I know. Well, if I answer now, you'll never learn a valuable lesson about trust, Jennifer.

		Excuse me, I received a text message About free sephora samples.

	starburns

		Oh, yeah, turn to your left. Oh, now turn to your right. Yes, we can see both of them. It's like a constellation on your face.

		Oh, what's up, dude? Yeah.

	thug

		Okay, we get it. You and the A-team are awesome. Now beat it.

		If you're trying to be menacing, maybe don't call the cookie by its name.

		Who's there?

		Why don't you get going, Chuck Norris?

		You picked the wrong day to correct my Spanish, no sleeves. It's on!

		No, I want to beat the crap out of you. And I'm gonna enjoy it, because you're just like this school. You're obnoxious, you're cramping my style, and you smell like French-fry oil.

		Three O'clock, bike rack, But not the one by the parking lot!

		Yeah.

		Can I ask you a question? Are you perpetually on your way to the gym?

		Well, 'sup?

		'Sup?

		'Sup? 'Sup?

		'Sup? 'Sup?

		'Sup? 'Sup?

		All right, just one sec. These are very expensive. All right...

		Your name's Mike, right?

		Mike, I'm not gonna fight you. I have a friend that believes this is the time of year where you put aside your differences, and you make peace. Me... I don't believe in any of that, but I do believe in friendship. And as much as I hate you and the cast of breakin', I have to ask myself, what would Shirley do?

		I think...

		That she would shake your hand and wish you a Merry Christmas.

		Not the moneymaker. Not the moneymaker!

	troy

		Shouldn't you guys be studying?

		Listen, it doesn't matter. You lose the jacket to please them, you keep it to piss them off, Either way It's for them. That's what's weak,

		Word 'em everywhere.

		hey, Troy sneezes like a girl.

		what'd i tell you? Okay, but, uh, never again.

		No you are not

		I am not 40. I can hear you through the window, morons.

		a movie of the week.

		did you know they had a football?

		you sure you made the right call on the football team, troy? it looks like they won something once. "most valued customer. henderson trophy cases."

		Hey Troy, can I talk to you for a second?

		Do you ever miss being a quarterback, Troy?

		You still know what to think, Troy

		For instance, after Dean talked about you playing football, you and I were thinking the same thing

		You were thinking, what if Troy did play for Greendale You'd be surprised how many of your favorite football players got started at community college

		Who's your favorite player?

		Maybe you and I should checkout the Greendale Thunderdome

		the dome arrives later. it comes with thunder. let me tell you a little secret about me, troy. every day on my way to school, i drive through downtown past the courthouse just to get a glimpse of the world that i once ruled. and i just wanna jump out of my car, run up the steps and... exploit the legal system for profit. but i can't. i'm locked out of my old kingdom. you're not. you see what i'm saying?

		i'm saying you're a football player! it's in your blood!

		your soul.

		your eyes?

		that's homophobic.

		that's racist!

		when you played, you were a god. now you're not playing, and you're not. i'd tell you to do the math, but math isn't important. the only thing that's important is this.

		annie said that benjamin button was compelling. look, she's a smart girl, but sometimes she's just wrong.

		it's like a drug, isn't it? feel it, troy. throw it! the scoreboard lights up. there will be a scoreboard there. it's complete!

		the girls, the glory, the scouts, the career! it starts when you join this team.

		look, you can meet them later. but this decision has to be yours, t-bone. and this decision has to be yes.

		because you're a football player, and your name begins with "t." your name begins with "t."

		what?

		you got the most you were ever gonna get out of football in high school. a life of disillusionment and depression begins on the other side of that door.

		well, buckle up, troy. i was exaggerating. it's kinda my gimmick. let me tell you something--

		yeah.

		what?

		Okay, uh, guys? I'm at a grownup Halloween party, all right? You're all being unseemly.

		What makes you think that?

		I'd offer but my dad's kind of racist.

		what do you think?

		Whatever you do, don't tell Shirley about the fight. She'll start in with all her mother-y, guilt-inducing powers. You know what I mean?

		Yeah, I got some... theories.

		Technically, no. I guess I'm too charming and likable. Call me a name.

		And a good one.

		Guys, I appreciate the enthusiasm, but, uh, I think I got this.

		Good plan.

		'Sup!

		'Sup?

		That's pretty good.

		Idiot.

		It is hard to think of another word.

		Why do you guys do stuff like this?

		Come on, guys. Can't you see the pattern there? Can you see it? It's Beau... Beau Bridges! These are all things you can see on TV... Except for Pierce... That's a misdirect.

		Well, every other guy on campus does.

		I see what's happening here. Troy, I want you to clear your head.

		I'm gonna describe to you a complete stranger who happens to be in our study group.

		But the point is, we're not telling you what to do.

		More specific than the stuff you told me about Britta?

	reporter1

		You got chops, kid, but we need your talent On a bigger story. Pizza wars--who's got the best slice in town? Start with big nick's. Bring us a large, with sausage.

	reporter2

		You. I heard a rumor that riley's liquor is Selling to underage students. I need an undercover expose. Find out how much they'll sell you Of anything cold and imported.

	shirley

		is that even close?

		Shirley has a response to that.

		please, Shirley.

		Hey, Baby.

		Yeah. Shoot!

		Let's do it.

		So you've got a kid, right?

		Nothing.

		I know a lot of grown men With radar dishes coming out of their ear.

		Yeah, go, go, gadget incontinence.

		I know! He's the worst! Vaughn?

		It's perpetually moist.

		I am so glad to be able to talk to someone about this. I wanted to say something to britta about it, But we're supposed to be friends now, And she'd think i was jealous.

		Shirley, we're not pandas in a zoo.

		That is not what i want to see.

		Shirley, did you see senor chang's socks today? Tiny bullfighters.

		Look, i'm trying to be a good friend to britta. She thought i was gonna make fun of him, But i want to be unpredictable. I am gonna show her that i am not the jerk she thinks i am And friend the hell out of That green-Tea-Drinking drum circler.

		Not engaging.

		No!

		No!

		You are the devil.

		Donde vaughn ustedes los sabados?

		"Did you ever notice where the ocean meets the sky, did ya? It's the same wizard blue that i see in your eye, brit-Ta."

		Yeah.

		Look at this, look at this. That is the stain of a teardrop over the word "rad."

		I am surprised he can read.

		You know?

		He's more like a puppy with a fish mouth.

		We shouldn't show that.

		Britta is never gonna forgive me. I can't believe i showed you that poem. Oh, my god, my life is degrassi high.

		Hey, look at the size of that woman's earrings. It's like little dogs should be jumping through them.

		Look at them.

		Shirley, don't do this. Look, we can still hang out. It's just, you know, we won't bag on people.

		I was a lawyer.

		Well, we'll always have "tiny nipples."

		Details.

		Details!

		Details!

		Oh, hey. Awkward. How small is this campus?

		Oh, thanks, Urkel.

		Really?

		I'm not living in my car. I'm just sleeping in it for a couple of days while I work at some problems with my condo. It's a very temporary issue. I've got to pay some meaningless fees and then they'll put my locks back on the door and that'll be that.

		britta's trying to give up cigarettes.

		I can get dates anytime I want.

		He meant we were figh... ...ting.

		December 10th?

		I don't think my brownie's working.

		Again, it's December 10th.

		No, no. To me, religion is like Paul Rudd. I see the appeal, and I would never take it away from anyone. But I would also never stand in line for it. And look, Shirley, the die has been cast with this crazy bully guy. He picked on Abed, and he corrected my Spanish. So you go to your party, and I'll see you soon.

		Well, you don't get to. You're not my mom.

		Oh, come on, Shirley, don't be mad.

		That's "mom" for mad.

		Yeah!

		Actually, I was gonna say merry semester and happy new one.

	britta

		oh, hey! spanish.

		whoa.  I wouldn't dream of it. I just wanted to let you know about my spanish study group.

		i'm taking the class as an easy credit. I'm actually a spanish tutor.

		Board certified.

		yeah, i was willing to bet, i'm Jeff. Or "Jefe". We meet at the library at 4:00.

		You gonna be there? Un po' di piu'. That means "See you there".

		Bienvenuto! Hey, all right, come on in.  I got the whole table. Welcome.

		Yeah, here's the, uh, contact sheet. Just put your stuff there. Man. Rest of the group is running late. But you and i can get acquainted.

		yeah, i like big talk. what's your deal?

		what's your deal and is god dead?

		You'd be surprised what gets back to these guys.

		Marry me.

		honesty?

		ah, that's a good deal.

		uh, i would have to go-- I would have to say, um, honesty, Because, I would say anything to get what i want. And i want you to like me. So, uh,

		really? Wow. you're easy.

		I just need five minutes, you guys, So go ahead and study all the verbs,in spanish.

		you guys aren't gonna believe this, But the rest of the group, Is here.

		uh, listen.

		yeah, but they're filtered, so that makes them safe.

		yeah, not mine, actually. I think Abed took out a page on craigslist. And i was trained never to say this, But i think that group may be untutorable.

		so why don't you and i go study over--

		or drinks.

		i'm certified.

		Yeah, untutorable. You like Thai food? I love Thai food.

		Why can't you see that for the compliment that it is? Ok, ok. I'm sorry. It was an accident. I did a little bit of lying  to get close to you. But how was I suppose to know that you were smart and cool, I mean, you look like Elisabeth Shue.

		What do you want me to do?

		Okay, if i do that, then dinner, right?

		Oh, you're gonna eat those words when you see my new car.

		Fine.

		Really?

		You know what today is? The two-week anniversary of my horrible first impression.

		Not specifically, but if you think of grandsons as a metaphor for friendship, I think you'll agree with this transformer here that it's time for ours to become a man. By reading from the Torah.

		Exploit them? They're my friends.

		She said I was cute.

		What are the odds?

		I gave Abed my shirt because I'm not selfish, which is something I guess you'll finally  discover while we are working on this. Tomorrow night? Dinner, drinks.

		Thanks. I like what you've done with the place.

		I am. I'd be happy to show you the ropes.

		He is paraphrasing.

		He's jumped in the fountain. He's fine.

		Morning.

		Nice try. It's actually secretary's day, and it says that I'm sorry about crashing your protest with that drunken, self-immolating baby boomer.

		Well, how do you know I didn't do it just to get another shot at you?

		No, I know. I thought of that.

		Britta.

		Britta.

		i have to plan in advance How to prove that i live in the moment. I mean, i'd rather take an actual class, But now it's too late to drop or add.

		hey, if you're making a documentary About Britta patting herself on the back, You're gonna need a backup battery.

		guys, guys, stop it. stop it.

		Britta back up. stop.

		professor Whitman comes by here every morning And i need him to see me celebrating life. What's all that?

		um, all money is spending money.

		happened yesterday. Shirley's just doing her homework.

		drop the flower.

		ask him.

		abed is not normal. That's what you bought When you intentionally tangled yourself in his life.

		i've got problems of my own! I'm out here trying to seize a day!

		What in the hell? Is he gonna kill us?

		hey.

		i lied to get you here Because it's time to communicate.

		it's not the two of you that need to talk.

		All right, now, the only reason Why this whole mess got started Is because both of you wanted the best for abed. And i think the lesson we can all take away from this Is that everyone should always do Whatever they want and leave each other out of it.

		The point is is that Britta is sorry, right?

		guys.

		guys!

		he's not normal.

		it's not exactly citizen kane.

		that feeling is called the joy of freedom.

		honey, let him leave the nest.

		sorry.

		you owe me. That cannot be comfortable for you.

		yeah. fooled you.

		Yeah. I forgot to stagger the timing of my exit with shirley's. We both have a class across campus, and i can't go That kind of distance with "ooh, that's nice."

		No. that's not nice.

		Yeah, but i'm a sprinter. I am at my best during high-Speed bursts of wit. On a shirley walk, i'd be winded by that stoner tree.

		Interesting. 'Cause i might be worried If i was playing hacky sack a decade too late.

		All right, but i just wanted to point out That we easily walked more than 100 yards With no awkward pauses, And that is the sign of a true friend.

		There's the awkward pause.

		Hey.

		Hey, i'm fine. How are-- Want me to, uh, Want me to check you for grass stains?

		Uh, first of all, Friends do not make fun of each other, Even if they're being tackled in the quad by a hippie, And secondly, vaughn seems cool.

		Oh, no worries, brah.

		Oh, i'm good.

		Where do we go on saturdays? You said sunday.

		Oh, he--He's very cute.

		School?

		Dinner mints?

		Not having sex?

		How was that?

		Herpes?

		A poem?

		Well, it's a very good question. And it's one i will answer. Uh-- Ooh, i'm getting a text. I am just gonna read it, if you don't mind. I am reading it, and it is read.

		No, i know, and i'm sorry. I am really sorry. I am really, really sorry, And i will go talk to vaughn if you want me to.

		Oh. Oh.

		I know, and i'm sorry, But i was in a tough position. I couldn't handle just being one of the girls.

		Is there a spot on the friendship spectrum Between total stranger And having to hear about the guys you date? And ideally, just a notch underneath Driving you to the airport and painting your kitchen?

		Done. And if i'm occasionally naked in your dreams, I won't complain.

		I know. She's got a problem. She stirs the pot. She's a pot stirrer.

		so...i guess the cell phone number You put on the study group's contact sheet was fake, Which i just learned in the awkward conclusion Of a month-long text message affair with a dude from boulder.

		that's okay. Just give me your real number. I'll cleanse my palate while kevin rethinks his marriage.

		uh...pass.

		remember when we used to study spanish?

		so... Wow.

		yeah, well, when we first met, Like you were up here and i was here, and now... Oh, wait, i gave a quarter to a dirty bum today.

		hey, if you show up with me, follow my lead, And deny everything, you'll walk. That's the winger guarantee.

		i can neither confirm nor deny that. See how good i am?

		miss perry... Did you make that crib sheet?

		what are you doing out there?

		you're on trial for cheating! Fa--look, we'll be fine. I just have to go back out there And make the case that you're a good person--

		wait a minute. Wait, is that what you thought i meant? Britta, look at me. Look at me!

		no, look how handsome my face is. If all i wanted was sex, I could get it from plenty of women Without having to go through all this crap. I'm here because i like you, And i--i'd be psyched to be your friend. I just didn't want to take sex off the table Without doing my due diligence.

		well, why wouldn't you?

		wait. i think we have our defense.

		no problem. just glad you're here.

		girls go in groups. did you learn nothing from stand-up comedy in the '90s?

		well, then you should know that nothing says "i'm a woman" like doing it with me.

		Oh, I have a conflict. It conflicts the enjoyment of my life

		Speaking of enjoying a life, I don't want to beat a dead horse here, but are you sure you don't see anything not platonic ever crystalizing between us?

		OK, good. Because one of my professors is really hot, and I wanted to give you the first ride of defussal

		Oh, hey. Awkward. How small is this campus?

		Well, it's funny, I enrolled here as selfish loner, but you and the group have given me a crash course in friendship.

		She's grading papers.

		What are you doing here?

		You had to have one to get in here, Squirrel.

		I don't know what you're getting at.

		Okay, uh, guys? I'm at a grownup Halloween party, all right? You're all being unseemly.

		Britta, I don't care about your high school soap opera.

		In fashion, I'm what's known as a tastemaker.

		And next month, so will Gwen Stefani. Here comes Vaughn. Bye.

		I'm not living in my car. I'm just sleeping in it for a couple of days while I work at some problems with my condo. It's a very temporary issue. I've got to pay some meaningless fees and then they'll put my locks back on the door and that'll be that.

		Believe me, kitten, Winger's got moves.

		Wanna see my place?

		No, my real place. The condo board's trying to bluff me by listing my place as available. Look at those faucets. Handcrafted in Italy. 100% expensive.

		Yeah. Move on with my life. "Shmove shmon shmith shmy shmife. " This condo is all that's left of me. Every part of it is a part of who I am.

		That part's for resale value. And Saturday afternoons.

		There's a silver lining here, isn't there? You're attracted to bums.

		Come on. Why don't you have dinner at my place? I got a hot plate that plugs into a cigarette lighter.

		Stop! That's my house!

		In the last two days, I spent a quarter.

		There's a communal bathroom down the hallway. It actually helped me come to terms with losing my condo. You don't sit on a toilet like that until you've left the material world.

		This is Pavel. He lives next door. He's from Poland.

		Knight Rider marathon.

		What are you doing? That was the Jeffersons, honky.

		But they had good times.

		Jeez, you are way out of your element here.

		Thanks, coach. Can you turn the tv back on?

		Italian faucets, handcrafted. These look like... Wait... I made this notch to indicate optimal cleansing temperature for combination skin. These were mine?

		You're into me.

		Look at all this work you're doing just to have me around again. You were may more attracted to me than you were willing to admit.

		Yeah. Clearly.

		I saw how much you missed me, and smelled what happens to Pavel on cabbage night, and realized the world was better off with me in it. Thanks... For, uh... Caring.

		would have been nice to have that option 27 minutes ago.

		britta, i'm saying this Because i care about you And you're my friend. You need to start smoking again.

		ten-to-one says it's him.

		you yelled at me too.

		wow. wow.

		How was hypnotherapy?

		you realize this will never end.

		* wa-wa *

		yeah, but it didn't do any good. My head still hurts from all the yelling. And my pupils are more sensitive to light Because he yelled at me so much.

		fake outrage? justify my-- Yeah, that's it. i'm out of here.

		uh... He's getting a refill on his void.

		mm, kinda.

		It has been a dry spell. But that's only because it's been a while since I've tried. So I'm trying.

		Yeah, I can see that. This is a lot of outgoing calls. "Car wash redhead. Tube top, REM Concert." "Juror number six." That sounds aboveboard. At least you have "mommy" in here. It's not my mom.

		You saying "dude" is not cool. What are you doing?

		You're welcome.

		You're right. I can't believe I haven't seen it before now.

		Well, I'll be here... Rethinking my way of life.

		Call mommy.

		Take a vote.

		They won't.

		Last name Beeswax, first name none-a-ya.

		Stop it!

		Well, then she would know it was hers.

		Come on... we're not making fun of you. But obviously, you kept it a secret because you saw the irony too.

		There are exceptions to the rule, but even when Jerry Rice went on dancing with the stars...

		Good job up there.

		Oh, she's getting a permission slip from the Dean to allow us to drive home together.

		Yeah, I guess. You actually had a big part in that. I mean, if I can handle having a girl for a friend, who's to say I'm not ready for a girlfriend?

		Yeah. Is that... that's what people do, right? I was gonna throw them up on stage, but I thought they might catch fire.

		See you Monday.

		Her name is Michelle, and how did you know?

		You weren't kidding.

		You know, it's nice to have a girlfriend with a sense of humor and one who recognizes good work.

		Why is Annie talking to micro-nipples?

		you know what I don't get? He never wears a shirt. He never wears shoes. Why hasn't he died from lack of service?

		Yeah, you know, everyone talks about his nipples, but his feet freak me out.

		Get to the cute part.

		And you gave it?

		Look, this isn't about you, you groovy hipster. It's about Annie. We're like her Greendale parents. You got to say no to that stuff.

		Yeah, not if you're 28 and you're fooling around with him. She's 18. Her taste in men is still being established. Creepier and creepier dudes will start thinking of her as an option, and it all starts with Vaughan. He's a gateway douche bag.

		And that can be your toast at her shotgun wedding to starburns.

		Oh, yeah, turn to your left. Oh, now turn to your right. Yes, we can see both of them. It's like a constellation on your face.

		Oh, my God. He's got her in some kind of hippie collar. I can hear her armpit hair growing from here. We got to do something.

		Well, I know if we say we disapprove, we'll just drive her further into his hemp-braceleted arms. We need to be smart. We need to hatch a scheme.

		Let's not confine ourselves to your wheelhouse. This problem won't respond to tap dancing or casual revelations that you spent time in new York.

		Thank you.

		It's all very simple. In Annie's world, long before Vaughan, she only had eyes for Troy.

		Crash course in manipulation... you don't actually tell the person what you want them to do. You help them realize they want to do it so it can't be traced back to you.

		Would you excuse us for a moment?

		What?

		Sure.

		To Annie's inevitable breakup with Grodie j. McConaughey.

		Why would you say that?

		Both cute?

		We'll see. Put on something nice, and find me after lunch.

		This is what it was about for you? You were jealous?

		Yeah, that kiss wasn't for pleasure. It was strategic and joyless.

	abeddad

		wow, i can't believe i missed out On getting involved in this.

		guys, guys, stop it. stop it.

		Sir, you have a right to your faith And your family's privacy. But abed is an adult and a u.s. citizen.

		and he has the right to stay.

		wait, what?

		they're coming.

		All right, now, the only reason Why this whole mess got started Is because both of you wanted the best for abed. And i think the lesson we can all take away from this Is that everyone should always do Whatever they want and leave each other out of it.

		interesting. hadn't seen the iraq metaphor, but--

		got it!

		guys.

		guys!

	debate

		This feels so formal. Let's just talk. People are evil. They can't help it.

		take jean here. She spent a lot of time this morning Making herself look so lovely.

		man is evil.

		When i talk about people being evil, I could cite quotes or dig up statistics, But those are just words and numbers. I think we could have a little more fun If i express myself in song. * evil woman * * ba na na na na * * evil woman * I knew you could do it. That's my time, everybody. Thank you very much. Yeah!

		in the stanford prison experiment, 21 out of 21 students, when given absolute power, Abused and tortured their fellow students. My competitor likens people to pure, falling snow. I would respond, "there is none righteous. No, not one." Now i realize mr. simmons' quote Was from the great franz wickmeyer. Mine was just from a simple desert handyman Named jesus.

		abu ghraib.

		hate crimes.

		ketchup is a vegetable.

	group

		I'm gonna go to the bathroom And bring my jacket, wallet, and keys with me In case there's a fire.

		all right. Look at this crew. All ready to study all night.

		but who studies with strangers, right? My name is Jeff.

		you know, i've been a part of a lot of study groups that fell apart because of unresolved tension. Shouldn't we address Annie's concern?  Did we not invite her?

		Dirty Dancing.

		Uh, I'll be right back. But while I'm gone, you guys need to hash this stuff out. No stone unturned. Go!

		All right, everybody! I want to say something. Everybody, sit down.

		You know what makes humans different from other animals?

		We're the only species on Earth that observes Shark Week. Sharks don't even observe Shark Week, but we do. For the same reason I can pick up this pencil, tell you it's name is Steve, and go like this. And part of you dies just a little bit on the inside, because people can connect with anything. We can sympathize with a pencil. We can forgive a shark. And we can give Ben Affleck an Academy Award for Screenwriting.

		People can find the good in just about anything but themselves. Look at me. It's clear to all of you that I am awesome, but I can never admit that, because that would make me an ass. But what I can do is see what makes Annie awesome. She's driven. We need driven people or the lights go out and the ice cream melts. And Pierce. We need guys like Pierce. This guy has wisdom to offer.

		We should listen to him sometime. We wouldn't regret it. And Shirley. Shirley has earned our respect, Not as a wife, not as a mother, but as a woman. And don't test her on that, because that thing about the jukebox was way too specific to be improvised. And Troy. Who cares if Troy thinks he's all that? Maybe he is. You think astronauts go to the moon because they hate oxygen? No! They're trying to impress their high-school prom king. And Abed. Abed's a shaman. You ask him to pass the salt, he gives you a bowl of soup, because you know what? Soup is better. Abed is better. You are all better than you think you are. You are just designed not to believe it when you hear it from yourself.

		I want you to look to the person to your left. Sorry. Look at the person sitting next to you.

		I want you to extend to that person the same compassion that you extend to sharks, pencils, and Ben Affleck. I want you to say to that person, "I forgive you."

		You've just stopped being a study group. You have become something, unstoppable. I hereby pronounce you, a community.

		I agree with Abed that tonight has been very special. And now, if you'll excuse me, I have a dinner engagement with Britta.

		Britta?

		And I'm happy to report that one of the benefits of being a lying creep is having all the answers to tomorrow's test. And I'm happy to share them with anyone whose time I've wasted more than they've wasted mine.

		I make things up, and I got paid a lot of money to do it before I came to this school-shaped toilet. I was a lawyer.

		I don't have any of the answers. I'm gonna-- I'm gonna flunk the test.

		I am me, Well, the funny thing about being smart is that you can get through most of life without ever having to do any work. So, uh, I'm not really sure how to do that.

		Oh. Were you waiting? talking about your interesting personal lives and your cool emotional problems. I just feel like I never have anything to offer. Truth is my life is emptier than this three-ring binder.

		So what's a guy got to do to get a "C" around here?

		you guys, i found it. the ultimate blow-off class. Professor Whitman. he thinks he's in dead poets society. There's no tests. there's no work. It's just "day seizing." The deadline to enroll is tomorrow. I suggest you all do it.

		you guys, are we going to study spanish Or keep getting involved in each other's personal lives?

		29 seconds.

		it's a study group and a pizza. Let's not get carried away.

		I am gonna go save britta from that dude.

		flattering. But if i'm gonna cheat, I'm not gonna write information from a book Onto a piece of paper. That's practically learning, for god's sakes. Whoever made that crib sheet wasn't a real cheater. Just...insecure and naive.

		now let's meet the minimum requirements for a language credit, shall we?

		Enough. I want you guys out of here.

		The next person that offers me charity or pity will be mentioned by name in my suicide note.

		in a way, all of you are right. Okay, what was i tuning out?

		guys, what makes you think i can convince chang of anything If i can't even convince you not to make me do it?

		you want me to risk the "c" That i'm pulling in that psycho's class By putting myself on his radar? I mean, that guy goes any more nuts, He's gonna win a grammy.

		because i have you guys.

		fine. i'll do it. But when you find my body, don't believe the suicide note.

		uh-huh.

		if anyone should be disappointed, it's me. What kind of a group threatens to kick someone out Unless he helps them?

		helps himself? I don't think i like being talked to that way!

		that's what you guys want.

		You know, i thought hanging out with you guys Was the worst way to pass spanish. I was wrong.

		thanks. What are you guys talking to me for? You go dance!

		Some mysteries solve themselves, don't they?

		Ooohh...

		Oh, come on.

		What is this, some kind of joke?

		You know what I have? Finals. Are we cramming for Spanish or not? I need a 65, or I'm gonna flunk the class.

		Guys, this is a subject that breeds conflicts. Can we please do...

		I'm agnostic.

		As an agnostic, I'm gonna bring my winning smile.

		And thanks to all of you for showing up and having my back when we fought those fly dancers. So, uh... Merry...

		Let's get one thing straight. I wish I was still a lawyer. I'm only here because I'm hot for britta, And I don't want to be anybody's friend. Just kidding. Bring it in here, ya knuckleheads! You know, I gotta say I took a look back At the guy I was last semester, And I realized that guy was a drag.

		No, the truth is this is a new semester, A new jeff. Greendale is where I am, And I am gonna make the best of it.

		You know who you guys sound like? Me, from last semester. Cynical, elitist, Rakishly good-looking.

		Hey, don't ask me. Dealing with problems ain't my job no more. My new job is hanging out, having fun, And cracking wise.

		Hey, buddy can sing, you guys. Wow, that's great.

		Did someone say something about a meeting To discuss member policy?

		Holy crap. Wow. It says here some guy in seattle went nuts And killed his entire driver's ed class With a meat tenderizer.

		Everyone stop studying.

		Does anybody have a problem with how that was handled?

		I invited him. Buddy's crime is thinking we're cool. But I get it. I mean, if I were him And I missed out on you guys, I'd be sitting in that classroom, Watching, wondering. So how can I exclude someone from something That I'm so lucky to have? I say we let him in.

		Well, has anyone called him?

		Can't I be the friend in the group whose trademark is his well-defined boundaries, like privacy smurf, discreet bear or... confidentiality spice?

		You all remember Michelle Slater, my professor from last semester? As most of you may realize by now, she's the woman I've been seeing lately.

		The important thing is we all understand Professor Slater and I need this to be our little secret. Everyone understand that?

		What the... none of you left the room. How is that even possible?

		All right, all right, maybe we're not a family. Maybe it's more complicated, because unlike a real family, there's nothing to stop any one of us from looking at any of the others as a sexual prospect.

	buddy

		Well, I appreciate that, but-- Did you just teleport here?

		Well, you already broke the only rule I have. The rule about worrying about rules.

		Annie's pretty young. We try not to sexualize her.

		no, no, it's fine, it's fine. It's just a little nosebleed. I get 'em when it's dry And when my face gets kicked.

		Buddy, yesterday the group took a vote. And you seem to have figured out the rest of it.

		Oh, come on. Be relaxed, like me. Leave.

		Buddy, just be reasonable and go.

		Okay, so since buddy's not leaving, He'll just be the person who we wish wasn't here While we study. Try getting that deal from hitler. Shall we?

		No, you're not.

		You're not in the group.

		Hi, buddy. Welcome to the group.

	duncan

		If these guys knew you like I did they would have given you a small office.

		you got to stop saying that.

		Well, 2002 was a simple time.

		i'm a student.

		uh, i am in a bit of a jam. The state bar has suspended my license. They found out my college degree Was less than legitimate.

		now i have to get one from america. and it can't be an email attachment.

		yes, and i'm hoping that our friendship Will yield certain advantages. You know, academic guidance,

		moral support, Every answer to every test For every one of the classes that i'm taking. Here's my schedule.

		okay. Duncan, you, did seem less into integrity The day that i convinced 12 of yours peers that when you made that u-turn on the freeway And tried to order chalupas from the emergency call box, That your only real crime was loving america.

		thank you. Duncan, you are a good man.

		No, and if i wanted to learn something, I wouldn't have come to community college.

		I couldn't stop watching them. There's a guy going for the track, that's older than the game of poker. He's kinda cracking.

		i would say, "go for that," And could have said so in a text.

		i discovered at a very early age That if i talk long enough, I could make anything right or wrong. So either i'm god or truth is relative. And in either case, booyah.

		duncan, you don't have to play shrink  To protect your pride. I accept. you're chicken.

		No, I'm just using regular psychology on a spineless, British twit.

		a six-year-old girl could talk to you that way.

		No, because you're a five-year-old girl And there's a pecking order.

		thank you.

		Hello.

		What's wrong with your voice?

		I knew you could do it, buddy. Thank you.

		The satisfaction of being even.

		What do you want from me?

		My car for a semester's worth of answers?

		You know, bluffs this weak are how your people lost the colonies.

		What am I supposed to drive?

		Yeah, so is wiping your butt with a leaf, but it's not how a man gets around! A golf kart!

		Why are people trying  to teach me things At a school that has an express tuition aisle? Give me the keys.

		probably the same as teacher life, But less tragic, because i get to leave.

		Britta?

		you know, you have the savoir faire of a hyena. How is it that you and james bond Come from the same island?

		How can senor chang be one of the judges? He's the one accusing my client.

	self

		Bienvenido.

		oh,they will be, untutorable.

		She looked back.

		jackpot.

		holy...war.

		shazbot!

		it's showtime.

		crap.

		Whoa. Shirley would have said something funny about that guy.

		Oh, no.

		He must have heard us call him inspector gadget.

		yes!

		"i'm jeff. and i'm a student at greendale." that's not good.

		damn it.

		I can't believe I'm doing this.

		What in the Pink Floyd?

		ooh.

		"You will get aids."

		"Unless you go to the STD fair."

		Crap! Ahh...

		That's not enough.

		Oh! Ow!

	humanbeing

		holy crap!

		Bite me.

	leonard

		oh, come on, leonard. If you're gonna argue with me, put on a bathing suit.

		Shut up, Leonard. Nobody even knows what you're talking about.

	simmons

		i don't care, dude. I'm doing this for a parking space.

		dude, leave her out of this.

		that's it. dude, we are gonna debate The living crap out of you.

	slater

		Bernoulli's one of my favorites. Little-known fact, statistics were not his only love. He's also famous for his French sauce used on meat and poultry.

		Oh, we may need to settle this at a restaurant.

		Are you being sarcastic, or am I nailing it?

		Oh, damn it. Starting over. Hey, you in the skirt, date me.

		Thank you.

		You know if you agree to go out with me...

		I'm barely a student. I'm older than you. I drive a Lexus. I saw "Ghost Busters" in the theater. Look, my gums are receding.

		Have a cup of coffee with me. I bet I can change your mind.

		There you go, pretty lady.

		Showing you my non-student side.

		You're reminding me of my first time too.

		No, with an attractive woman at a party. We seem destined to repeat history.

		What friends? I have no friends. I hate everyone here but you.

		Oh, well, when you say "classmate", It sounds like we take naps together and eat paste, but what's great about community colleges is that a lot of the students are just as mature as the teachers.

		Well, where were we, little doggie?

		Yeah. Crap.

		Please sleep with me. Please. Pretty please. I'm so lonely. I haven't slept with anyone in a very long time, and you are so good looking. Please do me the favor of having sex with me.

		I promise. I promise.

		Just... Just keep walking. Don't make eye contact.

		I, uh... I think I have to say goodnight.

		Uh, no. Um, they're my classmates.

		Professor Slater, quick question.

		I'm actually kind of seeing someone right now, thank you very much.

		Fine for now. She's smart and pretty. But sometimes I feel like she's just waiting for me to stop talking and take off my pants.

		I've never been someone's dirty little secret.

		Wow, you do like statistics, don't you?

		Hey, midterms and whatever.

		It's dead.

		I have study group right now, and nobody uses intercourse to mean anything other than sex.

		This is a wall of windows. My study group's behind it.

		As soon as we touch, the blinds will open, and six annoying but loveable misfits will be staring at us.

		Fine.

		Mm-mm.

		See? All good.

		Sweet.

		Wow, it's on there.

		What?

		It's semantics, really, isn't it?

		The best friend ever.

		Michelle.

		I got freaked out by that boyfriend label. I'm... afraid of commitment.

		Look, the biggest truths aren't original. Truth is ketchup. It's Jim Belushi. Its job isn't to blow our minds. It's to be within reach, so the truth is... I get claustrophobic when things get official.

		Let's get back to it. Should I get the door?

		Yeah, but soon as you say it, it can get complicated and messy.

		Because when you say it, later on, you might have to un-say it.

		Boy, that guy's really taking a pounding in this conversation.

		I really liked what we were doing. And if the ratio of work to pleasure can really stay at that same level, I don't care what it's called. I'll do it. Let's do it.

		Okay.

		Okay.

	vaughn

		You in line?

		Oh, no, i was just gonna see if britta--

		Hmm.

		Tight. Yes. I've heard that about green tea.

		Yeah, give me some of that.

		So britta said that you did a lot of community service.

		And what makes frisbee ultimate?

		You know, i'm gonna really-- I am gonna think about it.

	chang

		That doesn't sound fair to me at all.

		Your breath away? Well, tough.

		How can senor chang be one of the judges? He's the one accusing my client.

		she confessed to protect her classmates, Because you were threatening to flunk everyone!

		Oh, look, it's the eavesdropping matador.

		What?

		You going to the faculty party? Make me your plus one.

		Give you 20 bucks.

		Please slow down, please

		Watch it!

		She blew you off too, Chang.

		It's this campus. It feeds on my coolness. I... I got no moves anymore.

		What is it?

		can i ask you a personal question, senor chang?

		did your wife leave you?

		well, when you pick juries, You learn to read the little stuff. Same shirt twice in one week. teaching us the word "esposa" means "liar." The picture of you with a woman With a post-it note dialogue balloon above her head That says, "enjoy it while it lasts."

		mm.

		stop salsa dancing. of course i know.

		yeah. you look like you would have to. I'm not surprised you said that.

		uh, are you offering or collecting?

		dude, you are gonna be fine.

		you just have to move on. And if you hang out with me sometime, You will see how great single life can be.

		yeah.

		absolutely. Oh, shoot. My spanish study group has to get together every night now. You know, you have been really Letting us have it with this homework.

		yeah.

		fantastic. that is fantastic. everybody will be so happy.

		right. yeah.

		here's your jacket. let's do this.

		thanks.

		hey, when you go out with me, it gets crazy. That's the winger guarantee, huh?

		ooh, yeah, i want to. It's just the quiz, you know? Study, study.

		you know, i knew i could do it if i applied myself.

		cher--cherry daiquiri.

		daiquiri.

		let's see. "I took a computer class..." The apple store. Adorable.

		and the saleswoman had manzanas gigante. Ruined it.

		seven times! Seven different women agreed to marry that guy. it's cra--

		come on man, it-- come on, don't do that.

		yeah.

		no, no, it's fine. It's just--buddy, you know...

		i can see that you're hurting. Um, but i have to get to accounting. And it's not like i'm hitting strip clubs With professor whitman.

		what?

		well, i'll have to think of something. Let me rest gently on your pecs.

		actually, i had an idea for an extra credit project.

		i didn't tell her you wanted to talk.

		thank you.

		"True or falso or none of the above?" That doesn't make any sense.

		Senor Chang, can you do something about this?

	pierce

		i was just going to ask.

		definitely!

		Pierce! Let's discuss this creepiness.

		Are you unaware that Shirley Finds your advances inappropriate?

		Pierce, I'd like you to say, "I forgive you."

		I don't have a study group, Pierce. I made it up.

		An excuse to punch a hippy?

		I deserve that.

		You keep getting married.

		Shouldn't you guys be studying?

		You smell nice. Vitamin P.

		I'm not much of a sausage guy, Pierce. Maybe next time.

		Yes.

		I can't. But you can, so that's fine. So, the assignment is to,uh, write a Spanish conversation using those five phrases.

		We don't need to make this a long evening. We can just..

		What? No!

		To the irony of that sentence.

		Well, I guess that it's... I think it's Britta.

		Why don't we start with me saying...

		Our assignment.

		Oh, My God in heaven.

		What we have so far? We have something incredibly long, and very confusing, and a little homophobic. And really, really, specifically, surprisingly, and gratuitously critical of Israel. And it's called "two conquistadors", should probably be "dos". I mean, it is a Spanish class. Oh, which reminds me, the only thing not included in this epic are the five phrases required to get me a passing grade.

		I'll tell you what we're gonna do. We're gonna take this, and we're gonna  put it in a museum for crazy people. And then we're gonna take this, and memorize five phrases from it tomorrow morning before class. Good night.

		No. This is my definition of you trying way too hard, and me finding it harder  and harder to stay polite. Now this was a fine enough way to spend an evening, devoid of hope, but a woman I kind of like is out there in the moonlight caring about something stupid, and this is my chance to show her that  I care enough to act like I care about it too.

		That was it? That would've been great if I had done that two hours ago!

		It's a protest, Pierce.

		Pierce, I got an idea. Why don't you go get a cup of coffee, and hold some waitress hostage with a monologue about your sperm.

		Pierce, I understand that if you don't want to be my friend, but this thing we've created... It is bigger than the both of us, and it deserves to be done right.

		You ready, amigo?

		Thanks Pierce

		She's behind you. Not interested.

		Pierce, we are not making fun of you.

		Pierce, we were not making fun of you.

		We're making fun britta's boyfriend, vaughn.

		Pierce! Pierce, give me your ear-Thing.

		sorry to disturb you guys... who are clearly looking at a naked drawing of pierce doing jumping jacks.

		that's a falcon with a gun. now it's a falcon with an erection.

		wow.

		is that seal?

		Nice one. I'm not much of a costume guy.

		Pierce. Pierce. Pierce. Stop grinding on the women's studies department. You are too old to be tripping.

		You are too old to be tripping!

		You are too old to be tripping.

		Is that a death befitting a Beastmaster?

		I'm coming in there, Pierce.

		Well, when we go to floating skeletons with our problems, we get what we pay for, don't we?

		Pierce, I don't know how you spent the first 60 years, but I know in the last two months you've probably doubled the national average for amount of life lived per lifetime.

		Yeah. And, more importantly, you're dressed like a gladiator in a desk fort that you built during a bad trip. If life is just a series of ridiculous attempts to be alive, you're a hero to everything that's ever lived.

		Yeah.

		I'd like to be there when the band finds out.

		can you help me block out people's voices I find extremely annoying?

		Okay.

		I haven't.

		Unfortunately, I always know what you mean.

		I doubt it.

		You got that from "I doubt it"?

		Is there a pill that makes the word "no" clearer?

		I'm sure you're right.

		Well, I don't know the precise date, Pierce, because I'm not you, so there's no receipt.

		Hi, Pierce.

		That's nice.

		No, no. Because I didn't try. Because taking a date to an STD fair would be lame.

		Pierce.

		This is Sabrina. About 30 seconds after you walked away, I asked her to be my date for the fair, and she said yes.

		Yeah, I did.

		Yes, I am. Wait, how'd you do that?

		Wow, me in a dune buggy. With syphilis. This is going on the fridge.

		That sounds like the worst combination plate ever.

		I stopped. I don't know what's wrong with me. I mean, she's hot. I think this place is sapping my life force.

		Oh, I'm sorry, I was waiting for that to become inappropriate or racist. What happened to Doreen?

		Oh, man, that... that is rough.

		You'll get there.

		Cheers.

		Tell Doreen I say hi.

		I'll give you 250 if you don't finish telling me.

		Pierce, I'd like to commend you for letting that one go.

		For the same reason that I floss, have a bed frame, and keep my guitar in its case... I'm over 23.

		So help me if that jerk-weed made me fail.

		Whatever you do, don't tell Shirley about the fight. She'll start in with all her mother-y, guilt-inducing powers. You know what I mean?

		No, thank God. This is the moneymaker.

		Guys the plan here isn't for me to get hit. It's for me to hit him.

		Guys, I appreciate the enthusiasm, but, uh, I think I got this.

		Not if that's bad.

		What are you doing?

		I got hit in the face, like, four times before you punched me.

		Pierce, thank you.

		You're wrong, Pierce. It's two guys. Sometimes I do wish you were dead.

		I don't think it's like that.

		I feel if you need to explain it, it's not just like that.

		Everyone can hear you.

		Yeah, but they're honest.

	doreen

		Do you know a lot about wine?

		You know, you are not what I expected. You're smart, you're classy. You're not wearing go-go boots.

		That is going to suck.

		Trust me, I know girls I can converse with who are way more annoying. I will take "tinkles" over "we need to talk" every time.

		Doreen... it was very nice to meet you.

	whitman

		yes, i'm new. But i'll be old too soon. Carpe diem, sir. carpe diem!

		oh, yeah. his name's Pierce. I-i can talk to him for you.

		what? listen, i-i have never lived Until i met you. I-i love you. Oh, there's one down. nine to go. Not that i need the grade or even want it!

		you... This is no way to teach accounting!

		good morning, professor Whitman.

		damn it.

		Professor, will you look at the amount of work That i'm putting into this? I mean, throw me a bone!

		what does that mean?

		Hey, professor whitman.

	abed

		Abed, nice to know you and then meet you in that order. Now about that question that i had--

		Abed?

		what's the deal with the hot girl from spanish class? I can't find a road in there.

		holy crap. Abed, I see your value now.

		why?

		oh, i can't think of a single logical reason why not.

		there you go. Oh, hey, here. Put your contact info down right there. That's right.

		it's probably just for your eyes.

		Well, it's just, You probably,  it's probably just for your eyes.

		do you have to pee?

		hmm.

		well, i'm stumped. That's very creepy. That's very creepy.

		no, it's just someone With a misguided grasp of abbreviation.

		I just need five minutes, you guys, So go ahead and study all the verbs,in spanish.

		you guys aren't gonna believe this, But the rest of the group, Is here.

		where's Britta?

		it's the coolest.

		Well, uh, that-- That actually was from The Breakfast Club.

		Yeah.

		Yeah?

		Well, you have Asperger's.

		Well, that's the nicest thing anyone's ever said to me.

		That was for you.

		No, Abed, I don't want you to bring my car around. I'll bring yours around, good guy. You get going, all right.

		You want to trade cards? I'll give you 20 bucks.

		50 bucks.

		What?

		All right, fine. Give me your card.

		I have no idea.

		abed?

		no, are--are you going to take the class?

		hey, if you're making a documentary About Britta patting herself on the back, You're gonna need a backup battery.

		Right?

		well, that went well.

		i don't want to be your father.

		definitely christmas.

		i'm okay.

		no, really. i don't need anything.

		okay, i will get a small, black coffee.

		so, abed, how's film class?

		yeah? did you go to class today?

		not really. Well, Britta's paying for those classes. Don't you think maybe you should go?

		Britta.

		i think you are really weird, abed. And i think the wrong person just left.

		i don't want to be your father. I think you are weird, abed.

		i think you are weird, abed. And i think the wrong person just left.

		I am not 40. I can hear you through the window, morons.

		yep.

		i don't think so. let him enjoy it.

		not sure.

		yeah, they got us.

		abed, it makes the group uncomfortable when you talk about us like we're characters in a show you're watching.

		Okay, uh, guys? I'm at a grownup Halloween party, all right? You're all being unseemly.

		Abed, you're not Batman.

		Batman?

		Are you staying for the party?

		Can I live with you?

		Top.

		I don't think so.

		How are you so satisfied all the time? Don't you ever want anything more out of life than cereal?

		And some day you will know it by its true name, "diabetes. "

		I'm sorry?

		Is it the lips?

		Can I not be Kurt Russell?

		I could use a break.

		Tv's the best dad there is. Tv never came home drunk. Tv never forgot me at the zoo. Tv never abused and insulted me, unless you count Cop Rock.

		Doesn't it?

		Cool.

		Cool cool cool.

		I'm heading back. Pavel's making babka.

		Abed, it's open!

		I checked into a motel and I'm looking for apartments. You would've been fine with me staying there forever?

		You're pretty cool, Abed.

		Thanks.

		ridiculous.

		i have no idea what you're talking about.

		Thanks for dumbing that down for us.

		Because doing more than the minimum work is my definition of... failing.

		Uh, maybe you should just hang back.

		Whatever you do, don't tell Shirley about the fight. She'll start in with all her mother-y, guilt-inducing powers. You know what I mean?

		Technically, no. I guess I'm too charming and likable. Call me a name.

		Guys, I appreciate the enthusiasm, but, uh, I think I got this.

		Why do you guys do stuff like this?

		Of all your pop culture fixations, This is one I can work with, abed.

		When you've earned it.

		And with buddy gone, Staying that way will be a lot easier.

		That's enough.

		Who are you kidding, abed? I just dragged a screaming, crying man Out of a library with his pants down. No. Martinis are for hawkeyes. I'm the same uptight jerk I was last semester.

		The one with, uh, the army.

		Ooh. What's in it for me?

		I guess that's the upside, isn't it? Thank you...Radar.

		Come on, guys. Can't you see the pattern there? Can you see it? It's Beau... Beau Bridges! These are all things you can see on TV... Except for Pierce... That's a misdirect.

	annie

		Made it up. That's what I do.

		My Lady.

		Annie, Do you have any Spanish notes that might fit in there? Double-spaced. Thank you.

		Pierce will beat that in one minute.

		Well the galaxy is not going anywhere, I'll bring him back

		i'm not having a conversation with someone who emerges from a bush.

		no. because i'm not in a commercial for breakfast cereal. look...the dean has pictures of me, okay? horrible pictures of me... attending his school.

		maybe you should tell him you're hopelessly in love with him. high school must have been tough, huh? waiting for a superstar to notice you. but here...here... he's all alone, and he needs so much help! did you enroll in all of his classes, or were you worried that might freak him out? the important thing is that you are there for him. the important thing is that you are the only one there for him. and you don't really care what he wants... just as long as you don't have to share him with the rest of the world. because, really, you are just as selfish as i am. you're just not as good at it yet.

		profound, but technically meaningless. and don't bother trying that thing that women do where they walk away and make the guy feel like crap, because it won't happen! yeah!

		hey.

		look, i'm, uh...i'm really sorry about before. i just think we were both wrong.

		mm. okay, maybe i was a little more wrong. i should grow up and make peace with being here. i mean, it's not like greendale's gonna kill me or anything.

		this has the potential to be a uniquely greendale experience. milady.

		I'm definitely gonna try to swing by.

		Here's the thing...

		Are you trying to get formidable with me?

		Infomercials work on Pierce.

		This won't work. The last time you did this, I saved a vial of your tears and have been slowly building up an immunity.

		Look, I will come to your party.

		annie, i was a lawyer. I was a debater for money. I think i can handle this.

		never, because it's stupid, and i don't care.

		what do you mean i can't beat him? You and i are gonna study harder Than we've ever studied before And beat city college tomorrow.

		no, who am i, iCarly?

		look, six months ago, i was a lawyer. I wore suits. I used to say stuff like, "objection" and "sidebar." Now i'm losing a community college debate To Jeremy "Soul Patch" Simmons.

		We've got some preparing to do.

		uh!

		i have this weird pain right above my eyebrow.

		i hate it.

		well, agreed, but if you want to win, You need to loosen up. Go off book, robot debater.

		yeah.

		yeah.

		us. Kissing. That is ridiculous.

		yes. um, okay. The people are inherently evil.

		yeah. You know, maybe we should study alone.

		separately.

		Bye!

		well, i can get another one.

		i know. we're so in sync. It's like a perfect duet or great s...

		well, um, congratulations, buddy.

		oh, that's okay. i'm working on mine by myself. You could do my homework next time. See you in class.

		Sorry, not interested...

		Congratu... horrible!

		That's a hard-hitting question, annie. Are you a reporter?

		Well, now you love the streets. You're my ace news hound.

		We can do anything we want. It's greendale. Now go find me that story.

		You don't need to remind me.

		Okay.

		Have you called the number that sent it?

		I'm just saying it's not exactly watergate. I mean, you like the dean. He's trying to help you transfer.

		Annie, as your upbeat friend, I gotta say let this go.

		Didn't anyone tell buddy he was out?

		And you are not running that story!

		Because I said so!

		Annie, I'm sorry that I yelled.

		Well, it was nothing.

		We have an agreement to keep it low-key.

		Hey.

		Annie... We're sorry. We were worried about your well-being.

		What?

		What?

		Because you started having sex with Britta's ex-boyfriend.

		Or anyone else outside this creepy circle.

	jean

		I didn't catch your name.

		Tell me, jean. How many people bothered to tell you How great you look today?

		for my own selfish purposes. The fact is, as hot as you look, And it is quite hot, I wouldn't have said anything.

		i only got 8?

	secretary

		in ignoring your very important cause. Hi, I'm Jeff Winger.

		My casual friend and I are gonna have a non-romantic breakfast if you'd like to join us.

		Is it me, or are horses the most beautiful creatures? They're so majestic.

		I mean, just this morning when I was shaving and listening to the new Jay-Z, I was thinking about how I want to squeeze in a quick gallop this weekend.

		Can you ever really own a horse?

		I thought you'd never ask.

		Not as much as I should.

		What? I'm not a professor.

		I'm a student.

		Yeah, it's pretty much Yikers for me too.

		Mmm... You know, uh...

		I can't do this.

		Keep it.

		Yeah, all right! Bring it! Woof, woof, woof, woof! Greendale!

		They just come to me.

	dean

		listen, man. no offense, but i was the best, and i finished on top. i wouldn't play for this school with a 10-foot pole.

		Dean, I am not the best athlete on campus. Abed is.

	jeff

		that means you do my homework, right, Seacrest?

		Wait, you're that girl that got hooked on pills and then dropped out. You're little Annie "Adderall".

		Feet.

		Yeah, things got kind of boring after you left. Let me ask you something. People becloud me for wearing this jacket ever since I got here, but  If I take it off to make them happy, That just makes me weak, right?

		Wow. You just wrinkled my brain, man.

		You just, like, study for, like, an hour. It's not that hard. You seem pretty smart. You got a sports coat.

		No pressure.

		Word 'em up.

		Well, we're headed to the demonstration.

		Some cause Britta's into.

		That dude is crazy... He told me girls have two pee holes.

		i'm in.

		and how about i pound you like a boy? That didn't come out right.

		We are krumping.

		I miss being the best at something, miss having a coach I miss knowing what to think

		Oh good

		That dude looks like Moby

		Oh really? Name one

		Me. Woah

		you're saying i could be a lawyer.

		that's racist!

		that's racist.

		that's gay?

		that's black.

		damn.

		yeah, but annie said--

		is that linebacker a pregnant woman?

		how did you know my nickname's t-bone?

		troy! troy! don't go in there, man.

		you told me football was the most important thing in the world.

		no, let me tell you something. you know that keg flip that cost me my scholarship?

		i hurt myself on purpose.

		there was a scout coming to the final game at riverside and...i couldn't take the pressure, so i took the easy way out. but when you showed me that field, i saw there was nothing to worry about here. i could just play football for the fun of it. i mean, have you seen these guys? there is nowhere to go but up.

		i don't know about you, but i know i ended up here because things weren't that great out there. you should try accepting where you're at, man. take a pottery class or something.

		Jeff, Pierce took something, and he is tripping balls. He is touching people and dancing weird. it's like grumpy old men but not hilarious.

		She's pretty hot.

		Jeff. Jeff! Jeff. Pierce is freaking out. You're the only one that can help.

		He says he's gonna kill himself, but he doesn't want us to call 911, because he doesn't want to get in trouble for taking drugs.

		have you seen the film department's web site?

		wait, you are convincing!

		you are hilarious.

		ignore what she's doing. we are serious.

		you got a weird forehead.

		we found the stupid rat. And abed's gonna shut up about it now.

		No. I'm wearing this Jesus bracelet 'cause it gets me chicks.

		You're a pretty big dude. Probably got some moves.

		I can't.

		First time I got punched in the face, I was like, "Oh, no!" But then I was like, "This is a story".

		Yeah.

		Fight lessons in a half an hour?

		'Sup? 'Sup?

		No, it's a question. 'Sup?

		Not a real question, a rhetorical one. You have the answer. He does not. Okay, then you give him the forest Whitaker eye.

		Mm-hmm. Okay, hold that stare. There you go. Hold it. Then you look straight through his eyes and deep into his soul.

		I couldn't think of another word.

		'cause it's fun?

		Yo, I need my genitals.

		Maybe it's 'cause I knew her back in High school, before she dropped out. She had braces and acne and a pill addiction and a nervous breakdown ending with her running through a plate-glass door, screaming, "everyone's a robot!"

		Done.

		Annie?

		No kidding.

		Come on, you got to be exaggerating.

		Oh, man.

		And she's Jewish?

		I can't believe I didn't see that. Well, I guess she deserves another shot. Oh, wait, never mind. It's too late. I Heard she's hooking up with Vaughan.

		Hey, guys, thanks for taking ugly Annie out of the palm of my hand and turning her into yet another hottie that will never get with me!

		You did get weirdly specific when you were describing Annie's body.

	troyactor

		cut, cut. Let me ask you a question. do you hate this? Do you hate doing this? Do you?

		Just hold on.

	abed

		Right. What do you want to do?

		Hola, mi llamo Troy

		La biblioteca esta en la ciudad

		You have horrible breath right now.

		thanks for the pizza, abed. i was starving.

		no.

		no.

		no.

		[Dorky voice] Ew, i'm saddam hussein. Ew.

		[With jamaican accent] Hey, man, coming through. I love de desperate housewives.

		[Snotty guy voice] I am dr. Doogie seacrest. I think i'm better than everyone else because i'm 40.

		Just pretend like you're asleep.

		yeah, luis guzman is on a private jet from hollywood, Because he can't wait to have that conversation with you.

		because he called me on my cell phone.

		you don't know?

		i'm president obama's nephew.

		i didn't know if i could trust you. But now it's time to tell you everything-- Starting with me inventing the ferrari.

		hey, man, that stuff i said this morning wasn't true. I was just messin' with you.

		yeah, as a joke. You've never had anybody mess with you before?

		yeah, i know, but let me explain to you A few things about how this works. Uh, first of all, i cannot be got, Because i am not gullible like you. Secondly, you are not good at this, Because you are not believable in your face, okay? Your face? it's bad.

		um, also... You gotta ride the line between believable and-- what are you writing in?

		yeah, but what are-- what language?

		what are you doing?

		you trying to mess with me?

		yeah. You did.

		stop. stop doing this right now.

		i never thought you were. But this is insane, okay? Those are credible alien hand movements. You invented a whole language. I'm pretty sure you rented a green screen.

		it would be less creepy If you were actually an alien.

		no. From now on, abed, friends don't mess with each other. okay?

		cool?

		you're getting a little sloppy.

		mm.

		How many?

		Yeah!

		will you shut up, fart head?

		Hey.

		Can I ask you something I always wanted to ask the real Batman?

		Am I good looking?

		I knew it.

		I'm Batman.

		I'm Batman.

		Candy corn looks like tiny traffic cones.

		At, like, a candy traffic school. Like, a little gingerbread man at the wheel, and he's drunk.

		You'd be driving, But you keep wanting to eat yourself.

		That's one of my biggest fears.

		If I ever, like, woke up as a donut.

		I wouldn't even question it.

		It's cool to know other people think about this stuff too.

		yeah.

		why am i crying? what, i accidentally listen to come sail away by styx again?

		What? that dude gets it.

		simmons got robbed.

		Let me talk to you. can i talk to you for a second?

		what is this?

		i'm not afraid, abed. I choose not to be around rats because they are unpopular. Same goes for centipedes and lakes.

		yeah, did you have to pick a duet? Hmm?

		yeah, you don't have to warn me; i'm not afrai--

		Damn. Here comes Abed. he needs my help. I got to get out of here.

		why do you care so much?

		abed, take it from a former prom king. real friends help me with things. Not vice versa.

		exactly! 'cause you're my friend.

		oh, abed.

		aah, it's on my leg! It's on my leg! it's on my leg! Aaaaah! Disgusting!

		whoa, what model did you get?

		the devil's drench xj-11. This is gonna be awesome. We should establish base camps. What part of the library do you want?

		You think you're better than me?

		You stick to quotin' movie lines. I'll stick to sports.

		Well, you're not moving into sports. You and I are playing real basketball, right now.

		No, it doesn't! And it won't be.

		Don't gloat. It's impossible to guard you. Your eyes are too gentle and mysterious.

		Ugh! I can't believe you beat me again!

		Aah! We're arm wrestling. Ugh!

		The rules are you suck! Let's go!

		Aah! You broke my hand, you bastard.

		Yeah! Yes! Yes! How you like those apples?

		I know you let me win the race.

		That's because... I wanted it to be true.

		No, Abed... You are.

		Go, Abed, go, before people sex one another!

		Abed?

		Can you give me a glass of water?

		Shama-lama-ding-dong.

		This nose smells like the special drink

		You go, girl.

		Five letters... Broadway musical.

		Uh, six letters... to puncture.

		A water filter that starts with "B".

		Okay. Here's a tough one, though. Uh, Helen of...

		Oh, damn, you're good.

		I never even heard of that last one.

		One of the two brother actors. Bridges. Four letters.

		I know. Bridges.

		I love misdirects.

		You watching another movie in your dorm tonight?

		That sounds awful. I'll bring the popcorn.

		They're just jealous.

		I am kickpuncher. My cyber punch have the power of kicks.

		The only thing beyond the reach of my fists is humanity.

		You're sure Britta couldn't do your part?

	starburns

		We work really well together

		Me llamo T-Bone la arana discoteca

		Thanks for your time

	britta

		yeah, but abed posted this video two weeks ago.

		i liked you better when you were smoking.

		no, you're right. My feet are long and stupid. You can't unring that bell.

		yeah. you can be pretty cold.

		I am sick and tired of you saying that fighting is gay!

		Since last semester. Coach told me it would help with my coordination, and I fell in love with it, in a very straight way. I know it's tempting to sneak a peek, but I'm gonna need for you to keep your eyes up here!

		That's because you don't play football or have fun.

		Same here. Britta... Nobody can know about this.

		I am spending a lot of money on breakaway clothing.

		Are you saying we tell the group, together?

		Man, I don't know. Let me think about it. Okay, let's do this.

		Ahem!

		Bravo, Britta.

		Yeah. I changed my mind.

		I'm not gonna be in the recital. I'm dropping the class.

		Hey, you don't get to talk to me like that. You are not Shirley! And Shirley's not my mom.

		Britta, it's not like we were in the same boat. Girls are supposed to dance. That's why God gave them parts that jiggle. But I'd be going from starting quarterback to a guy that twirls around in tights. I've got way more to lose getting up on that stage because I'm a man.

		Not anymore.

		Easy, girl. There we go.

		Being a friend and a man.

		No, thank you. I mean, you looked so pathetic, you made going up there the most masculine option.

		I know chemistry is sexy. But Annie? I don't see it.

		Maybe it's 'cause I knew her back in High school, before she dropped out. She had braces and acne and a pill addiction and a nervous breakdown ending with her running through a plate-glass door, screaming, "everyone's a robot!"

		I can't believe I didn't see that. Well, I guess she deserves another shot. Oh, wait, never mind. It's too late. I Heard she's hooking up with Vaughan.

		What?

		Hey, guys, thanks for taking ugly Annie out of the palm of my hand and turning her into yet another hottie that will never get with me!

	vaughan

		I'm not your bro... Bro.

		Yeah, well some things are more connected than others, like tarantulas and me peeing my pants... Or me and Annie.

	group

		i'm leaving my homework with slumdog millionaire over here.

		Okay, I am the Barack Obama of this room.

		That dude makes a lot of announcements.

		One-liner.

		what's so funny?

		then he should see aladdin. jafar was a bad-ass.

		Who is this guy?

		He just said it!

		the only difference between senor chang and stalin Is that i know who senor chang is.

		All of abed's films are about us.

		check it out.

		this is wrinkling my brain.

		that's wrinkling my brain.

		where's abed? I need to talk to him about his films.

		get him!

		well, we're screwed too. We're three days behind on our biology lab.

		jeff does raise a good point.

		No. This is. "Don't eat the crab dip." Yay-yay!

		Who is that?

		Jehovah's witness.

		Yeah, but we don't celebrate birthdays or Christmas, and we can't drink. But it helps.

		I want to go to Jeff's fight.

		Oh, it was so awesome. Me and abed played this video game. It is so dope. It's a whole city.

		You can rent an apartment.

		But don't get audited 'cause that's bad.

		Right now it sounds as boring as real life, But it is not.

		I can't stop thinking about his high kick. His ratio of girth to hip flexibility Is mesmerizing.

		Oh, the last thing I said to him was "suck it".

		Um... M... my secret... is that... I knew Britta's secret.

		Yeah. I saw her in her dance outfit, and she looked ridiculous. So I helped her protect her shame. You know, I'm just glad she's out now.

		A little bit.

		For one... Crazy stalker?

		troy! troy, troy, troy. that's my name.

		Pantsless grandpa.

		Taking a call girl to an STD fair. There's a joke here.

		Maybe it has something to do with crabs. They're like a food, but they're also a disease.

		Troy!

		Hmm? Ow!

		Oh!

		Oh, my God!

		Water it!

		Oh.

		I have the weirdest boner.

		saying she turns you on is the harassment, dude.

		well, this teenage boy  is a quarterback and a prom king.

		He's got a point.

		I forgive you.

		Burger for your ass.

		He's really good.

		I hope your mom didn't make you take baths together 'cause one of you would've been like, 30.

		Well, we're headed to the demonstration.

		Some cause Britta's into.

		tell me more.

		What is that? It looks like your bluetooth thingie.

		Sure.

		ha ha. you said weiner. that's funny.

		Hey, man, what's going on? You have a full-on erection. Just rela... Just relax.

		that works, yeah.

		pierce. I hope that's the tiny gun That you throw at us to confuse us While you grab the giant gun That's duct-taped to your back.

		Oh, it's pepper water! oh, it's pep-- Who puts pepper in water?

		Now I get it. It sounds like "penis". I just got it too.

		Yeah, in your face, Billy Joel.

		Do you know how foolish you sound right now? What else do you believe in, blood transfusions?

		Dude, that is not cool!

		Why does she have to be black?

		You would never catch a Jehovah's witness saying "Jewie".

		Thanks, Pierce.

		Pierce, you don't want to watch a cyborg movie in Abed's dorm. You want to lay on your twin bed and think about what you used to be.

		Yeah, that's messed up, dude.

		Yeah, but you're doing it with the speed and the determination of the incomparable Robin Williams.

		Do they do stuff to your butt?

		Do you get paid more if they do stuff to your butt?

		That's fine. I will do it. I am in.

		Hi, abed. Hi.

		No, no, no! Annie! What is going on in there? Why--? What is taking so long? I've wasted all day here for you. The soul train awards were tonight. You promised butt stuff!

		Hey, sorry about bailing on the psych experiment.

		Wait. Is this still part of the experiment?

		well, i may be stupid, But i'm not trying to look like i'm not.

		jeff said you'd say that.

		Look, I'm Annie's backpack.

		Say there are two friends and they're in the same class and one wants to ask the other one out on a date. Like a grown-up date, but within biking distance of his parents' house.

		Cool. I bet Randi would love that type of thing.

		You thought... Can't believe I misled you like that. Listen... Randi can be the name of a guy or a girl. And in this case, it is definitely a girl. Thanks for your help.

		Annie. Annie. Thanks for your advice about "a night under the stars".

		I got to figure out what to bring to the picnic. This is my first college girl so I really want to impress her. Would you mind helping me shop for this stuff?

		Really? Thanks. Later.

		A picnic blanket. Genius. I was gonna lay down on newspaper.

		Yeah? That's pretty hot. Thanks.

		Right. I couldn't have done this without your help. You're really nice. We should've hung out more in high school.

		Oh ho, yeah. yeah.I'm funny. All right. I got to go get ready.

		What?

		Cool. I'll see you.

		Nice. I'll be thinking of you.

		Did you... say it already?

		No.

		I have a regular class at that time. It's like math or other regular classes.

		Hey... Annie. It's me, Troy.

		Nah, I'm not looking for my other half. I'm looking for you, girl.

		Yeah.	 Let that sink in for a second. You know, I never noticed how... Beautiful you are.

		Tell him. Tell him that you've been in love with me since High school.

		Well, he's a baby. Now, where were we?

		Come on. Everybody knows you want a cut of the t-bone steak. Jeff and Britta told me how you feel.

		Oh, you're even hotter when you're angry. Let's do this.

		i think, actually, we should prioritize here And study first and then go to dinner. And if they really prove to be untutorable, we'll slip out early.

		what are you doing?

		It is a disaster in there.

		Wait, so, this is a game to you? You put human beings into a state of emotional shambles for a shot at getting in my pants?

		You're unbelievable.

		Oh, maybe one decent thing could be to go in there and clean up your mess.

		Yeah, fine, whatever. As if there's a dinner on Earth that could make me forget you are a shallow douchebag.

		I lied. Thanks for calming everyone down. but since you're not a Spanish tutor, just a lying creep who purposely upset everyone in an attempt to get with me, I'd appreciate it if you left and stopped wasting all of our time.

		Shouldn't you be rolling around on a bed covered in test answers?

		You know what? Jeff, actually, we didn't get that far without you, so if you want to come back upstairs--

		Well, it is your study group, so.

		I think there's something that the  group would like to talk to you about.

		If you're gonna study with people, it would be cool of you to show up on time.

		There's a card for that?

		Look, Jeff. You're harmless enough to me cause a life full of ups and downs has given me douche-ray vision, but those are good people in there, and they trust and respect you. Watching you exploit them, kinda bums me out.

		You're cute, but selfish and narcissistic to the point of near delusion.

		Are you sure you didn't adjust the odds? I know Abed's been eyeing that shirt for three weeks. It's almost like you gave it to him so he would switch cards.

		I think that's something we should discuss with our partners. Oh, see, I did switch cards.

		Nice sign.

		I think I was a little too harsh on you. I'm not perfect.

		Morning.

		Oh. no, I get it. Garfield's wishing me a happy Arbor Day, And you'd like a fresh start.

		So. That was one of the worst things I have ever seen, which I guess makes being a part  of it, a pretty selfless act, so I'm impressed.

		Cause a smart guy like you would know that no woman in that class would be able  to look at you as a sexually viable candidate ever again.

		Jeff.

		it is not fair how hard it is for you to cheat here.

		that is so wonderful. Some people don't like getting involved In other's lives. I think it's great.

		that is brilliant. How did he react to you signing up for the film class? that part hasn't happened yet. here he comes.

		What? Why are you dressed like an '80s rapist?

		i am calculating abed's expenses For the semester. You know, there's books. there's meals. He's renting that camera. And, you know, he needs a little spending money.

		That guy's really got your number.

		look, i really need to talk to you about abed. I went by his film class today. he wasn't there. He's cutting. I want to know why he would do something like that.

		every time i try to ask him about it, He just keeps filming me and telling me That i'm playing the role of his mother.

		look, will you just-- will you please talk to him?

		hey. You don't really have tickets for ravi shankar, do you?

		communicate. have you met abed?

		wrong.

		okay, look, i need to talk to you about abed.

		i feel a little out of the loop here.

		i made this all happen.

		he's smoking.

		get your hand off my knee.

		for someone who doesn't like getting involved, Well, i owe you.

		hey, um, you should kiss me right now.

		we're even.

		You forget something?

		That's mean.

		I find shirley very easy to talk to, And besides, aren't you supposed to have, Like, an olympic gold medal in jibber-Jabber?

		My class is that way.

		I am really glad that you're not hitting on me anymore.

		Hey.

		I wasn't sure how or when to bring up That i was hanging out with vaughn. I figured that you'd make fun of him...and me.

		Well, you guys should hang out sometime. I gotta go. I--Uh, that was tacky out there. You won't ever see that again.

		I am gonna get dessert. Want anything?

		Domingo, pl-- Oh, okay, I--

		I have a question for you. You like vaughn, right?

		I am just worried That he's thinking a little bit more intensely About this thing than i am. He says stuff, you know, after...

		After...

		After...

		Ahh...

		What? Forget that. The problem right now is that he's calling me "babe." He's trying to hold my hand. It's getting a little relationship-Y. And he gave me something.

		No. This.

		How do i respond to something like that? "Thank you"?

		I can't believe you.

		I do not want to talk to you.

		Vaughan broke up with me.

		You broke my trust. You suck.

		What do you want to be?

		How about the friend level Where you sometimes have to cat-Sit?

		sorry.

		I'll give you my number if you promise not to use it In any other context than friendship.

		yeah, i bet you're enjoying this.

		what do you think they're gonna do to me?

		i'm not gonna sit while some hokey tribunal Gets its jollies judging me.

		i get it. You think you're gonna save my bacon Using your lawyer powers And send me into fits of grateful arousal.

		no.

		Jeff, come on.

		you know i have a problem with dishonesty.

		you don't know that. You're just doing all of this 'cause you want to sleep with me I mean, you said it yourself. You don't even want to be my friend.

		i am.

		i actually believe you.

		i don't know. I guess...same reason that i cheated. I...just have more experience being worthless. I think i left that crib sheet on the floor Because i wanted to get caught. I'm so used to screwing everything up I just wanted to get it over with.

		what?

		just don't talk to me for a while.

		what? she's offended?

		i'm familiar with the concept. i'm just-- fine. if it's important to shirley, i'll go with her next time. i'm willing to try some more mainstream feminine stuff.

		nothing says, "i'm a pig" like you.

		Are you not going to Annie's party?

		I'm sure

		It's nice of you to be here. Sure you'd rather be out with your hot professor.

		She blew you off, huh?

		Hey.

		What are you doing here? You should be over at the library with Annie... Whoa. Yippy ki yay. Thought you weren't a costume guy.

		Oh, so where did you get it? 'Cause I wouldn't think that any costume stores would be open this late.

		I think the words that you're looking for are "I own a cowboy outfit." And it is tight too. Did you buy it like that? Your toy gun to my head, I'd say yes.

		How are we unseemly?

		Are you okay? It looks like you have actual bed head this morning.

		And you missed an entire side of your face shaving.

		Crap.

		Hi Jeff. We were just talking about how in today's economy...

		How you'll get the money?

		Those faucets are beautiful. You know what they would go great with: a home, which you no longer have. You need to move on with your life.

		Is that a bidet?

		You know, downgrading your lifestyle is your chance to grow as a person. Maybe even become one. The less you have, the more you can be. You know what I'm saying?

		Good night.

		Yeah, but your kitchen's being towed.

		Wow, you guys are really dorming it up in here, huh?

		See? Who needs platinum faucets? Do you guys even have faucets in here?

		Excuse me, I have a future murder victim to visit.

		You guys weren't in spanish class.

		I was wrong, okay? Material possessions are important. Think how much happier the Jeffersons were than that family on good times.

		Well, do good times really matter? What about good cars, good lobster? What about that... That sport where the British people ride the horses with the really long hammers?

		Yes, and I do not believe a single word I am saying for me. But for you, maybe you're one of those rare people with nothing underneath the surface. Maybe if you put stain remover on a turd, you don't get a diamond. You just get a turd with less direction in life.

		Faucets.

		For a fancy condo, you've got awful security. Install those in a new apartment so that every day, when you're spending way too much time on your hair, you can look down and think, "I was a huge phony before. I can do it again!"

		I beg your unbelievable pardon.

		I was doing this all for Abed. You are the worst.

		Hey, look who the cat dragged out and licked clean.

		don't tell them my business. I will slap that smug look Right off your pointy face.

		what? i feel bad for him. Plus, i just yelled at him.

		oh, did i hurt your feelings, pointy face?

		he fell down and screamed in pain While i laid there with my eyes closed To make him feel like a good hypnotherapist.

		it's already done. He just wants one more session.

		jeff, how do you think You're gonna keep pulling a "c" in that psycho's class If he keeps assigning this much work?

		well, did you talk to chang?

		we're all very disappointed.

		what's chang doing?

		you did that for us?

		Problem solved.

		Pierce really got to you, huh?

		Dude, not cool.

		Heh! "Hot blonde, Spanish class"?

		This is the phone book of a man in his 20s. The women literally have no identities. It's pretty shallow.

		Whatever. I'm gonna go study with Shirley.

		Mm.

		Why don't you just kiss him already?

		Maybe to some show tunes?

		And then you move to Vermont.

		Or he could have a row of jars Waiting for our genitals.

		Oh, it must be nice. Suppose I decide that's my job.

		They'll probably vote him in.

		Who is the lucky brunette?

		I am just trying to help keep you out of trouble. What if the next girl saw these?

		Irony?

		Thank you. Where's your date? Didn't she want to get my autograph?

		I heard you guys are official now.

		Makes perfect sense. Break a leg.

		Flowers.

		No, this is... this is good. You can hand them to me. Thank you.

		Missed you at lunch today. Did you slip out for a quickie with professor hot stuff?

		There's a gold star on your fly.

		Vaughan? Whatever.

		hey. How's it going? Did you hear? It's cute... Annie and Vaughan.

		She's into him. She asked for my blessing.

		Yeah. I'm done with him.

		He's not that bad.

		People collide. Things happen. It can't be controlled, right?

		Okay, even if I agreed with you, what are we gonna do?

		Mm, hatching schemes is not really my wheelhouse.

		Okay, if you're gonna get all upper East side about this, I think we're done.

		Okay, we need to hatch a scheme.

		So if Troy becomes a real option, Annie will drop Vaughan in a hippie's heartbeat.

		Right, Jeff?

		And to her and Troy. We did the right thing. They belong together. Plus, their babies will be so cute.

		Come on. You know that babies are extra cute when their parents are...

		Do you want kids?

		I did eat all the macaroni. It's messed up that he knows.

		Oh, please, you can't tell me that you weren't jealous that Vaughan had his hippie hands all over your debate/make-out partner.

	troy

		He's just laying low

		She probably just... you know... had to go number two

		i'm so sorry.

		he's hiding something.

		And then you move to Vermont.

		Vacations are wasted on the young. You guys gotta get out there and see the world at some point Or you're gonna miss your entire lives.

		Me too.

		Troy, since when have you taken modern dance?

		God, I should have never dismissed you as a shallow jock. Then again, we haven't really spent that much time together.

		I have fun tap-dancing. I started last semester too. It was always something that I wanted to do, but it was too embarrassing, so I never told anyone.

		Troy, who are we kidding? Look at how much time and energy we're putting into hiding something that we're passionate about. We are leading a double life.

		We should look at this as an opportunity to come clean.

		We could invite them to the dance recital on Friday.

		Sorry.

		Thanks.

		Hey. What the hell? I thought we were supposed to come out to the group together.

		Well, they're gonna find out that you dance at the recital.

		Oh, my God. How can you do this? I'm so disappointed in you.

		Well, guess what? A real man doesn't bail on his friends or on himself. You're a dancer, Troy. It's who you are.

		What are you doing here?

		Hey, Troy. Thank you.

		Chemistry... sexy. You know what else is sexy? Annie.

		You really don't see how pretty Annie is?

		Only to make you jealous.

		She's helplessly in love with you. She's only with Vaughan to get your attention. And you have to give it to her now.

		Oh, yeah, you didn't hear it from us.

		What?

	starburns

		Starburns, no.

	thug

		Why don't you just kiss him already?

		Maybe to some show tunes?

	abeddad

		i'm mr. Britta. That's right. i'm a woman with rights. And you can see my whole face.

		raising him means letting him follow his dreams.

		you don't know that.

		so's polio.

		abed wants to study film.

		hey! hey!

		you know, i had a father like you. And the day i finally cut myself loose is the day i finally started being happy.

		abed may not be a great filmmaker, But that doesn't mean that he wants to make falafel. You need to let him make his own decisions.

		yes.

	vaughan

		So i'll be done in, like, an hour.

		No.

		Hi.

	group

		okay, um, maybe we should get started--

		okay. Why don't we try learning "jukebox" in spanish?

		Everybody ready?

		Oh, What a shame. Maybe we should get started...

		Will you guys have some self-respect? You're obsessing over someone who does not give you a second thought. Meanwhile, in Guatemala, journalists are being killed by their own government.

		You know what he did that's really crazy? He offered me $100 to switch cards with him just so he could be partners with Jeff. I think he thought getting closer to Jeff would bring him respect in the group. I think he spent his whole life looking out for himself and he would trade it all for a shot at some kind of family.

		Guys, you've met vaughn, right?

		Who cares who made the crib sheet? The only real cheater Is the guy who's threatening everyone with a zero.

		guys, i really appreciate your support, But i've got to quit this time.

		those people look just like us. That's eerie.

		we had almost that exact conversation last week.

		this is too much for me.

		there's only one solution. Someone has to go to chang and talk to him.

		i guess it sounds crazy.

		he's using fake outrage to justify leaving.

		Atheist.

		Guys! Guys! Guys! Guys! Are we really gonna let religion divide us like this? I think there's one thing we can all agree on.

		That we would all like to have Jeff at this party.

		Well, I think it's obvious to everyone That this buddy fellow has a few froot loops loose. So I think no matter what we do, We gotta do it with grace and caution.

		Wait, so you kick high enough and you get in the group?

		Guys, guys, let's take a vote.

		Okay... On the count of three, Everybody who wants to keep buddy out, Raise your hand.

		Hey, everybody, speaking of secrets, Troy and I have something that we would like to announce.

		There's a dance recital on Friday, and I would be honored if you guys would attend, because since last semester, I... have been taking a tap class.

		I disagree. What about fred Astaire? What about Baryshnikov?

	buddy

		What?

		Well--

		So for the essay, we conjugate...

		Yeah, I'll tell 'em about it later.

		Hi, buddy. Can you, um...

	duncan

		wait, what?

	self

		Nice and pretentious.

		mm-hmm.

		Oh!

		Thank God.

		Huh!

		Oh, my God!

		Oh!

	extra

		no, you don't got it. I got it, abed. i got everything. What is wrong with you? All i want to do is take care of you. I know you're not stupid. are you doing this on purpose? Why won't you answer me?

	shirley

		Nothing.

		Believe me, every day in that country, people are being killed for speaking out. and the worst part of it is, when it's all over...

		It's gonna be as if it never even happened.

		You should discover that stuff on your own.

		You could start with this journalist Chacata-Panecos. He wrote an article critical of the government, and they killed him.

		Brownies?

		This is not how you do this.

		But this is tacky and lame. I didn't mean that. I'm sorry. What I meant to say is that this cause is really personal to me.

		No. I do things. I went to... I don't do anything. What can I do?

		You guys realize he was beaten to death, right?

		Well, it's more than  I ever accomplished.

		Shirley, thank you. Bet that doesn't happen to you a lot.

		Shirley.

		Shh shh shh shh.

		oh, no, i don't have to go.

		i'm going to the bathroom. would you like to come with me?

		maybe he didn't see you.

		maybe he had his blinker on too.

		yeah, whatever.

		makeovers. they sure have us programmed, right? i am a female pleasure unit. i require a new coat of paint.

		here's something i think might be fun. let's find out the number of makeup companies that are owned by women. i'll save you the trouble. it's zero. but of course you're saying, "britta, aren't you a hypocrite? "you're plastered with glitter and goo from head to toe, just like the rest of us." well, i also pay income tax and pull over for cops, but that doesn't mean i support--

		Wait, are you going to the bathroom?

		I'll go with you

		oh. are you finished? i mean, i have to go, but apparently, i failed yesterday's tryouts for the position of bathroom companion.

		you didn't hurt my feelings, shirley. i don't need to go to the bathroom with other people. i was just trying to throw you a bone because i like you.

		i've peed alone my whole life. women have always hated me. i don't even know how it started. maybe it was when i got boobs before everyb--

		i did it, i did it!

		Shirley, you took off your wedding ring

		It's fine. I don't care.

		Okay, fine. But just to repeat, I don't care what Jeff does.

		He's going to the faculty party.

		No, it's not about her, Shirley. I can't believe that Jeff would do this to Annie.

		Shirley? Shirley!

		So what are you doing?

		Why?

		Yeah, the long-neck, weave-having bank teller didn't feel universal.

		Shirley, that sucks.

		Everything you've done tonight?

		I totally get that.

		Let's go check on Annie.

		Yeah.

		What is he doing?

		No. Just want to show Vaughn some support to help smooth things over.

		I can't do anything with this.

		Ooh, I wanna see! I wanna see!

		Oh, well, thank you, Shirley. I'm gonna put that in the pocket closest to my heart.

		You're banning Jeff from the party? That doesn't seem very Christian.

		Shirley.

		Shirley, listen. I get that this is your first Christmas since your husband left you, and I don't know, maybe that's why you're being so stubborn, because you're trying so hard to re-create something that you're afraid that you've lost forever. But if you really want us to be your second family, then you've gotta start treating us like one, even if that means supporting us when we do things that you don't agree with. You can start by rooting for Jeff while he rolls around on the ground groping another man. That's what I'm gonna do.

		That was nice.

		I'm sorry, shirley, Your friend gary is so boring.

		Gary is off the table. He is a buzz kill.

		I will try to find the tools to survive.

		Well, I don't know how funny it is.

		No. I am upset about... something I can't talk about.

		Okay. Uh, did you hear that the shroud of turin...

		Wow.

		Shirley, I did not warm Jeff up. Nobody ever will. Do you think Professor Slater is getting flowers right now? Do you think that they are gonna go to the movies and hold hands, visit her parents? No. The only thing keeping them going was the thrill of the secrecy, and now that it is out, it is over, believe me.

		Ooh! You people? What do you mean, you people? I cannot believe I got to say that.

	slater

		Britta Perry, GED.

	vaughn

		Hey, vaughn, how's it going?

		I never even knew that's what asexual meant.

		I like green tea. I should make the change.

		I am gonna get dessert. Want anything?

		Hi, Vaughn. Can we talk sometime? I'm sorry about how things ended.

		Can't we still be friends? And isn't the word "later" already short enough?

		Guys, what the hell! "Getting rid of Britta"? That song was disrespectful to me and to the definition of "rhyme scheme".

	pierce

		Britta.

		voice command. Voice command. Voice command. Voice command. Voice command! would you please use the buttons?

		um, pierce, that's the dean.

		mm-mm.

		Who are you?

		Pierce, you're not gonna die! Look at me!

		Don't talk to Vaughn.

		Don't talk to Vaughn.

		So I asked you not to talk to him and you completely ignored me.

		Guys, what the hell! "Getting rid of Britta"? That song was disrespectful to me and to the definition of "rhyme scheme".

		Did you just defend my honor?

		no! I've got one for you. A doddering old fool Walks into a bar, tells a stupid joke, And i crush his windpipe with my three-ring binder.

		pierce, i would be grateful for your help.

		pierce, thank you. I really appreciate you helping me out.

		so what are you gonna do? Wave a pocket watch in front of my face And tell me i'm getting very sleepy?

		go to hell, you disgusting pig.

		pierce, i was awake the whole time. I was faking it.

		no. No, i was trying to make you Feel better about yourself.

		pierce, I can't smoke a cigarette Without thinking of a three-way in your hot tub. You did it.

		you're a genius.

		what are you doing?

		That's great. What does she do?

		No, the real reason men fight is to release their pent-up gayness.

		Uh, that does not sound like Buddhism. Are you sure you're not in a cult?

		I'm pretty sure that's a bong.

		You are not a Buddhist. You are in a cult.

		Pierce!

	whitman

		thank you.

	abed

		Abed in the house!

		we are in a library.

		do you have something balled up inside of you?

		that is weird.

		Abed,

		What's your read on that guy?

		so your dad has your whole life planned out for you? Are you even interested in falafel?

		abed.

		how much does a film class cost?

		hey, how's it going? How's your film class, buddy?

		that is so wonderful. Some people don't like getting involved In other's lives. I think it's great.

		wait, what is he saying?

		tell him that you want to stay and study film.

		abed, how's it going, buddy?

		is that a new camera?

		yeah, but your movie's for class.

		well, ooh la la.

		you better believe it.

		how's it going, buddy?

		what is wrong with you? All i want to do is take care of you. Why will you not answer me?

		abed.

		did you do all of that to me on purpose? That's not a very nice way to treat your friends.

		hi

		Excuse me, I have a future murder victim to visit.

		You guys weren't in spanish class.

		Never had him. Don't want him. Especially now. He's got a real Phil Spector vibe going.

		What am I supposed to do about that?

		Abed!

		No.

		I've gotta write a paper about that.

		No.

		Vacations are wasted on the young. You guys gotta get out there and see the world at some point Or you're gonna miss your entire lives.

		Well, thanks, Abed. It takes a lot of hard work, but you could always take a class.

	annie

		Believe me, every day in that country, people are being killed for speaking out. and the worst part of it is, when it's all over...

		It's gonna be as if it never even happened.

		Real stories... They don't have spoilers. You understand that TV and life are different, right?

		You should discover that stuff on your own.

		You could start with this journalist Chacata-Panecos. He wrote an article critical of the government, and they killed him.

		This is not how you do this.

		But this is tacky and lame. I didn't mean that. I'm sorry. What I meant to say is that this cause is really personal to me.

		No. I do things. I went to... I don't do anything. What can I do?

		You guys realize he was beaten to death, right?

		Well, it's more than  I ever accomplished.

		He's just laying low

		She probably just... you know... had to go number two

		shirley's not coming. but i'm here... to listen...girl.

		i don't-- know...sweetie. maybe...it's because men make the world go round? kleenex?

		oh, annie, screw him! there are guys out there that would kill to be with you. and if troy isn't one of them, that's him failing your standards. you got that?

		seriously?

		Thank you. I hate when women use Halloween as an excuse to dress up like sluts, you know?

		He just stepped out. He's gonna be right back.

		he's hiding something.

		oh, abed, i'm sorry. He probably found more rats And is very happy living with them.

		Problem solved.

		Have you never seen one?

		I think he was gay then.

		Okay, that's easy enough. We'll go to him and we'll ask him...

		I think I could do that. Mm-hmm.

		Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.

		Yes.

		You go, girl!

		Amsterdam, I think. I'll know more when I find my camera.

		Gimme back my bra, annie.

		Oh!

		No.

		I have something unimportant that can't ever move.

		I have not seen him around all day.

		No. No.

		Oh, that's a big crowd out there.

		Oh. She's his girlfriend now? Can't wait till he hears about it.

		Hi.

		Oh, yes. I still don't know if that's his first or last name.

		He has a sincerity I found attractive in a simpler time.

		wow, you and Vaughan.

		Well, what about you and Troy?

		Well, Annie, I would have to be a villain to tell you who to date, which I am not.

		Damn right. Give me some fivesies. Whoo. Turning it into a snake.

		I guess we feel like we're sort of all a family, and Jeff and I are like your Greendale parents.

		Oh, you want to be treated as an adult and a friend? Try not dating your friend's ex-boyfriend. Find your own man.

		No, I don't, but I also don't like seeing him with anyone else. Ta-da!

		Fine. I cared. I'm a girlie-girl. I like boys, and I don't like it when they're mean to me, and I don't like it when they stop kissing me and start kissing my friends. I'm not that cool. I'm not Juno, okay, homeslice?

		Annie, it's more than okay. Please date Vaughan.

	chang

		i did it.

		how dare you terrorize a class by threatening their grades. It's not that easy to get human beings to turn on each other.

		Senor chang, please continue. we respect your authority.

		I did it.

	secretary

		Oh, gender saved.



Speaker: abeddad

	britta

		oh, i get it! Because i'm arab, i must hate women. Let me tell you something, i love women. But i'm getting a major b-word vibe from you.

		you go host american idol And you stop messing with my son. He's a special boy. I raise him, okay? you don't raise him.

		dreams are for sleeping.

		it's clinically proven.

		you lost me!

		see, it was hard enough to talk to him before. Now we have this between us!

		hey, don't touch me!

		you don't touch me!

		is that your take? let me give you mine. You and your pillow-lipped girlfriend Got all up in my stuff because you wanted to be cowboys And then you turned chicken when you found out It will take more than speeches and guided missiles.

		make his own decisions? Have you met abed? you know who he is?

		he loves--

		my son is hard to understand. If making movies help him be understood, Then i pay for the class.

		with falafel as a fallback.

	self

		hey! you want to get involved in my family's business?

Boom. I was thinking, as a group, We could start saying, "you go, girl." Not in a way that's, you know, "oh, I'm so cool saying "you go, girl." But in a way that we're kinda winking at it. Bottom line, you guys need a chubby, agile guy. Did anyone see paul blart: Marl cop, Paul. Blart. Mall. Cop. I'm like that, okay? I'm fat and I'm... Physical, okay? And I'm strong. Hmm?

Speaker: duncan

	all

		Welcome, research assistants. If you turn your attention to the monitor, You will see that our subjects Are waiting for the experiment to begin, but... It's actually happening right now.

		You see, the waiting is the experiment. The duncan principle is simple. Namely, that the more control lost by the-- Yeah, i'm gonna write this down too, actually. That's a good point. The more control lost by the ego, The more gained by the id, Resulting in a surprisingly predictable Emotional eruption or breaking point, Known to ma and pa as a good old-Fashioned tantrum. Oh.

		Let's do this.

		Houston, we have an idiot.

		Okay, we're three hours in, so let's review what we've seen. And pay close attention to every subject's breaking point. We've got a shouter. That one's a stomper. Bye, hippie. There's a generic whack job, bouncing up and down Like a six-Foot child. Shaking. Write that down. Visible shakes. Look at the little one chase the big one. Look at him go. I am gonna make him go quicker. It's like benny hill looks. Whoo, ooh, ooh, get him. Come back again. Whoo, ooh, ooh, get him. All right? There's a bit of fun. It lightens the mood. And back to the present. And then there were two. Break.

		And he's out. We got him. strike three. You're gone.

		Do you know what? The longer they wait, the harder they break. Buckle up, students.

		It's not--It's not fair! It's not fair! Why, why, why? What are you doing? Put your-- Stop writing! Put your pen-- Give me that! Get out! Get out, you dorks! Get out!

		professor ian duncan.

		Wow, well, under the circumstances I'll recommend that the accused Be fully exonerated. On the condition that she receives Psychological counseling on a weekly basis From a trained mental health professional. Thinking maybe fridays, nine-ish, something like that.

		well, that cannot be an inspiring journey.

		i thought you had a bachelor's from columbia.

		well, you've picked a fine school.

		yes.

		no. Now, Jeff, just by asking that, You have insulted the integrity of this entire institution.

		Well, I do love America, I do love it, very much. I love chalupas. But, i'll look into it. 

		Jeff, are you familiar with the adage, "cheaters never prosper"?

		Act natural, pretend you are watching the athletic proceedings.

		suppose i was to say to you It was possible to get those test answers?

		i'm asking you if you know the difference Between right and wrong.

		oh, interesting. It's just the average person has a much harder time saying, "booyah," to moral relativism.

		Are you trying to use reverse psychology on a psychologist?

		i'm a professor. you can't talk to me that way.

		Why don't you take this car? It's good for the earth.

		Jeffrey, before you say anything, you may want to think about the gift you've been given.

		No. No, not that. An important lesson, my friend. You see, the tools you acquired to survive out there will not help you here at Greendale. What you have, my friend, is a second chance at an honest life.

		No, I have to keep your car for-- Don't hit me. Please, don't hit me. Jeffrey, Jeffrey! Are we cool? Are we cool? We're cool.

		ah! Jeff, Jeff. Good morning! How is student life, my dry-witted friend?

		Even though you're an eight.

		Which is a british ten, So i'm angry.

		But if, in spite of that, you are still interested, Then you may join the lab. Ah! Okay. You need to bring two human subjects. And it would not hurt your chances one bit If you could lend me a fiver. I seem to have left my purse in my duffle And my duffle in the boot of my lorry, so--

		Annie, why don't you, uh, go and tell our subjects That we're going to be starting the experiment In five minutes, okay? And annie... It's never actually going to start.

		Is it on pause?

		It's you! It's your fault!

		Yeah, subjects! Not rain man! I should never have let you into this lab, Miss annie fanny panties in a bunch!

		You were nailing it, until you had to ask.

		I'd like to, Mr. Winger. You're tall, you dress nice, and I've graded enough of your tests to know I'd never feel mentally inadequate.

		Only problem, I don't date students.

		It's uncanny how many of my buttons you're finding, but I have a personal rule about this, and I stick to it.

		Oh, I know you can. That's why you're not getting the chance.

		What are you doing here?

		I have to admit, this outfit's doing it for me. I may or may not have been deflowered by a junior rodeo champion.

		You lost your virginity to Robin Hood?

		I told you no students. It's unseemly. I go out with you, you tell your friends, it gets around the school...

		Unseemly.

		Okay, stay three steps behind and promise you won't tell anybody.

		Are you, like, a court-appointed guardian for these people?

		Goodnight, Jeff.

		You know the answer, Mr. Winger. I don't date students, even if you are no longer in my statistics class.

		Really? How's that going?

		She is.

		I've never had a dirty little secret. It's so unprofessional. But the sneaking does make the sex 38% hotter.

		Chalk.

		Mr. Winger. Would you come to my office? We never finished our intercourse.

		I know.

		Come on, what are the odds?

		Now, was that so bad?

		Why are they looking at me like I'm a zoo animal?

		I should get going.

		Jeff, it's okay. It's out. And you know what? It doesn't bother me. I'm happy.

		We've slept together every night for the last three weeks. How would you describe me?

		Well, uh... I guess I've had the wrong idea about us. But you know what? This is good. I'd be better off dating, um... an adult.

		How original.

		You're acting like I'm a Venus flytrap. I didn't want or need more than what we were doing.

		I can't now, because you went to the friend place. That's you getting official, not me, because unless there's something I need to know about the lunch lady or that blonde in your Spanish class with the infinite supply of leather jackets, somewhere between our 9th and 11th slumber party, statistically speaking, most people would call us more than pals.

		How?

		Whoopee flippin' ding, Winger. It happens 50 million times a day. It's the Jim Belushi of sexual commitments. It barely means anything, and it grows on what's there over time.

		Hope he doesn't try to "handsome" her to death.

		Well, it's still Christmas to all of us, and I made you all a little gift, because you're like my new family.

		It stands for "What would baby Jesus do?" And it's to remind us that the real meaning of this season is Christmas.

		Everybody put 'em on.

		Let's see 'em.

		Quick question... Are you all coming to my Christmas party right after the final, or are you stopping home to change into your Christmas outfits?

		Wow, don't we have a diverse little family. I say we open up this... this party to all faiths. I brought my star of Bethlehem, which led the wise men to the savior of all mankind. And you guys can bring a little trinket or doodad from your philosophies. Sounds good?

		What is going on?

		It's our Christmas, and I'm having a party. Due to my divorce and my relatives picking sides, this will be the only Christmas party I throw this year. Will you be there, or will I have another family letting me down?

		I guess he made his choice.

		As I told Jeff, no one that goes to the fight can come to my party. He's dead to me. And if any of you leave, you'll be dead to me too. Let's sing. # Jesus is a friend of mine # everybody! # Jesus is a friend of mine # Come on, everybody. You don't know it?

		I did my best to create a special Christmas for my one intact family, and... this is the thanks I get.

		There's nothing weird about Christianity.

		The cranberry sauce has real cranberries.

		No, no, no, no, no. Holiday.

		We'll know each other's voices.

		Oh, no. We have to be careful.

		I don't think violence is the answer When we make decisions about--

		I can top that. Did you see that hacky sack wears an anklet? Since when won't you talk about vaughn?

		Okay, but tell me you've noticed How small his nipples are.

		What? It's not gossip when it's fact. My kids have got hamsters with bigger nips.

		Oh, well.

		Jeff!

		Hey, you two.

		I know.

		Oh, no, no. "Wizard blue"?

		Thank you so much. You just brightened my day. I am so glad we can rip on that dude again.

		Oh, he said "rad"? I thought he said "bad." Oh, that makes it worse.

		Oh!

		I know.

		Right, right. It's more like this.

		Oh, no, it's fine.

		Honestly, jeff, how dare you?

		Jeff, wait! I am sorry i sold you out.

		Oh, jeff. I have a gossip problem. I stir the pot, jeff. I am a pot stirrer. This isn't even the only study group i've had this year. You see those ladies over there? I used to be in their group till they kicked me out. They call me "tattle-Ina." It's a bumblebee nickname. It's--It's cute, but it stings.

		Mmmmmmm!

		This is never going to work.

		This has to end. Mm-Mm, mm-Mm.

		Come on, jeff. What are we gonna talk about? My kids? Your--Your doctor career?

		See? I am already bored.

		they were tiny. Okay. Jeff, wait. Wait. I know i shouldn't do this, But one last little piece of gossip. Britta told me she had a sex dream about you. You still have a chance.

		mm-Hmm. Mm-Mm.

		Mmmmmm! Mm-Mmm.

		Mm-Mmm!

		and so i told him... Oh, hey--Hey, jeff.

		Bastard.

		Bastard.

		Hello. Here's your drinks, mates.

		I'm Harry Potter.

		Living in your car. You are living in your car. I'm sorry, I'm not good at being coy.

		Do you need a place to stay?

		be careful. abed thinks you two are gonna kiss. ridiculous.

		oh, that's nice!

		you just made us change. you could do it.

		speaking as one of the meek, As soon as i inherit the earth, you a dead man.

		i got an "a" on my presentation, And a lot of the credit goes to pierce.

		Jeff, you shouldn't take potshots at some poor woman just because you can't get a date.

		I'm proud of you for handling it peacefully, Jeff, like a certain little birthday boy. Real men turn the other cheek.

		You realize there's no other way for me to take this than as a giant middle finger to the most important day of the year.

		Jeffrey, I have two boys. And when we have a serious discussion, I find that a brownie helps them to relax. So why do you hate me and Jesus?

		Please don't do something so ugly on a day so important to me.

		You think religion is stupid?

		Jeffrey, I forbid you from fighting.

		You're right. But if you show up for the fight, don't show up for my party.

		I'm not mad. I'm disappointed.

		Jeffrey... Kick his ass!

		That is nice.

		Uh, jeff, can he really just decide he's one of us?

		Well, we should at least get together To talk about membership policies, right?

		Jeff! You're sleeping with a woman you already slept with?

	movie

		Will it get me through this movie?

	self

		Damn, I picked the wrong couple to follow out of class this morning. Jeff and Britta are dead air.

		oh, no.

		i believe that, uh, Fusing brownies with the, uh, internet Is going to create the next napster for brownies.

		oh, my--

		oh, that's nice!

		The Lord is testing me.

		Mm-mm.

		Oh!

		Oh!

		Mm.

		Oh! Oh!

		ooh! ooh! oh, heaven. My.

		hillary, thank you for getting people coffee. I love you.

		It's December 10th!

	abed

		yeah, it's nice. like a--like a picnic.

		Oh!

		abed, have you been racist this whole time While i'm telling everybody at church What a sweet little caramel angel you are?

		Hi Abed	

		oh, that's nice.

		careful, boy.

		oh.

		you tell me my future right now, you evil wizard!

		what do you need a paper for? You knew what was gonna happen yesterday, You middle-eastern magic eight ball. Pierce hurt his leg, Britta made troy cry. What's my destiny? Am i gonna die in a car? Is it gonna happen soon?

		i'm sorry. is that me being chased down by a werewolf?

		the situation being me being chased down by a werewolf.

		and that's jeff locking lips with annie.

		you're a fool.

		abed, abed.

		they kissed. You do have powers. I'm gonna die by werewolf.

		well, that's not gonna happen.

		no, you're not, abed.

		yeah.

		Oh, what is that interesting smell?

		It looks delicious. I'm guessing as a woman I won't be allowed to eat that. That's too bad.

		Uh, you... you watch bad movies on purpose?

		Usually when a movie's bad, I stop watching, but this sounds college-y.

	troy

		that's borderline racist, i think.

		It really is.

		oh, god bless you, dear.

		god--god bless you. god bless you.

		what?

		that boy's a soothsayer.

		Troy? What... what's your secret?

		Bravo!

	all

		estimation of market value Of--of--of brownies has-- Ahem! i, uh-- target group--

		uh... I--i--

		they are...wonderful. We all love...brownies. if you love brownies, you love life.

		here's brownie!

		Done. Hee hee. Hee hee. Hmm. Feliz Navidad.

		He did it, though.

		Okay, then let... let's watch kickpuncher 2, then.

	annie

		okay, okay. I'm sure i've made some bad life decisions And maybe Annie's decisions will be better. But i think she needs to decide Whether she wants to be considered a child Or an adult, because children get pity But not respect. And adults,  they get respect, But they also get the back of they head grabbed  And their face pushed through jukeboxes.

		I forgive you.

		I could make brownies.

		Need to bust out that brownie mix.

		i'll do it. i love robin williams.

		'scuse me!

		Oo, count me in. This is my first college party. I got some tequila and just rented Van Wilder 2: The Rise of Taj. And look

		Yeah, my husband has been gone for 6 months so I think it's time for me to embrace being single

		Tell that boy how you feel!

		You could. Love is a gamble always. But waiting won't change the dice. You either roll them or lose your turn.

		Shake 'em in your mind, okay? Excuse me, Pierce's band is playing and I want to record the train wreck. Kind of hoping for a Michael Richards situation.

		I know, sweetie. Let's go find you some pants.

		be careful. abed thinks you two are gonna kiss. ridiculous.

		Well, it's easy enough to practice.

		Annie... being a virgin in this day and age is something to be proud of. You're like a unicorn.

		So you, uh, you never seen one when you were growing up? Like, you know, on the Internet, in a picture, or Harvey Keitel's?

		I actually have no problem with that.

		Hmm, let me see that. Ooh, I can see through the door. Oh, yeah. Thar she blows.

		It's okay.

		No.

		That's my pumpkin!

		Uh, Annie... I... I didn't know you weren't, um, Christian.

		Oh, t... that's good for you. T... that's wonderful. I respect all religions of the world.

		Hello. Oh. Is this your Hanukkah holder? It's, uh... it's pretty. We'll just, uh... Let's just put it... There we go. That's nice. So I can't believe I never knew you were a Jew.

		So, uh, do you think everyone will start arriving soon?

		After Jeff's what now?

		On Christmas? Um, will you excuse me for a moment? And can you finish the manger scene?

		Oh, hash browns and applesauce... That's nice.

		Britta in a tutu... Can you imagine?

		First of all, I don't talk like that, and second of all, where I'm from, it's perfectly normal for women to talk about their male friends' backsides. And you don't see me saying anything crazy about abed and Troy's weird little relationship.

	slater

		That's right, professor Slim Calves. This is what you get when you steal Jeff from a good woman!

	britta

		Baby, you, uh, jumped a column there. What's happening in Guatemala?

		I never went to a real college.

		Can you at least tell us what to google?

		Can we have a protest? I want to protest the hell out of something.

		Raise the truth.

		Sounds like somebody has the case of "likes to use French politics to make themselves special, "but doesn't actually ever want to do anything-itis."

		That's where we got the idea from.

		We did it, girl... Page three. Its uh, mostly about Pierce, but listen to that last paragraph.

		And this isn't the school paper, by the way. This is a real damn paper, there's a marmaduke in there.

		isn't abed's dad a hardcore muslim?  They're not as understanding as christians. You can get your head cut off with a salami sword.

		Britta, um, it's amazing what you're doing for abed. I mean, a lot of people talk a good game. But you, you follow through. love you.

		Britta!

		uh, britta?

		well, yes, yes, i would. oh, that's nice!

		i had my blinker on about five minutes, and this no-good, clearly bald but trying to hide it with a bandana loser swooped right in. i couldn't believe it.

		he saw me!

		maybe. so you... got any family, britta?

		think my mom might visit this weekend. she and i are gonna get makeovers at that spa--

		just something i thought might be fun.

		uh, yes

		blue bird day to shred some pow. you know what? I'm good

		britta?

		oh, britta, i wasn't trying to hurt your feelings.

		oh. you can keep that bone. listening to a story about a stranger pissing me off and taking the stranger's side? and then you can't talk about your own business, but you insinuate my mama's a robot because she and i want makeovers. that is the ladies' room, britta, a place where ladies go to share, listen, support each other and... discreetly eliminate waste. and i like you too. even like that you're a little hard. but if you can't learn to be soft in there, you need to pee alone.

		shh, shh, shh. not out here. in there.

		who's my girl?

		oh, yes, you did!

		Yeah, my husband has been gone for 6 months so I think it's time for me to embrace being single

		It's disgusting the way men behave. Did you ever see that Katherine Heigl movie poster where Gerard Butler had that heart over his weiner? That resonated with me.

		Hello. Here's your drinks, mates.

		To be with professor "short skirt"? We hate her.

		Yes, absolutely. It's about Annie. We should go find that bitch's car and snap off her antenna.

		This is professor Robin Hood's office.

		I'm putting this hose in her desk, and you going outside to turn the water on.

		To teach that long-neck weave-having bank teller she can't steal another woman's man! That's why. I have a confession to make. I think some of what I just said may have more to do with my situation.

		My ex-husband came by this morning, and he, uh, he asked for his ring back. It was his mother's, and he wants to give it to his new girlfriend.

		Don't get me wrong. Best thing ever happened to me was him leaving. I just... I always thought he'd come crawling back, and I'd get to tell him, "go to hell." He couldn't even give me that. You know what the crazy thing is, Britta?

		It's like I was too proud to admit I was hurt, so I had to pretend that you were.

		I feel better now.

		Can you believe I targeted this poor lady? Look at all these awards. I bet she's nice.

		You sure you don't want a piece of that?

		I know exactly what he's doing. My ex-husband spent four weeks doing that after his "innocent mistake" of calling me Valerie. That boy's living in his car.

		Oh! They're pretty good. This isn't weird for you?

		i don't get it.

		i really think you should.

		they say it makes you lose weight, and your skin looks Really great when you do smoke.

		Britta, do you have a banana?

		I actually have no problem with that.

		Hmm, let me see that. Ooh, I can see through the door. Oh, yeah. Thar she blows.

		Okay, go, go, go.

		No, no, no, it's a bracelet. You put 'em on.

		Oh, look, Britta brought what she believes in... nothing.

		Well, that's an interesting point of view coming from an atheist.

		He can't come.

		He was raised in finland. He doesn't get our humor.

		He grew up in a land without sun!

		Is your heart gonna be okay with this?

		Okay.

		That's... f... funny.

		Upset about Jeff?

		We can talk about anything... politics, medicine, Jeff.

		Here's the thing about Jeff.

		Chasing after you made him a better person because you always called him on his stuff. All this time, you've been warming him up and stirring in sweetener and making him just right. And, sure, you weren't ready to take a sip yet, but that didn't mean you want somebody to snatch him off the counter and guzzle him down right in front of you.

		Can... can I just ask as a divorced black housewife... What part of being a single white slacker makes you people so jaded?

		It's the little things, isn't it?

		Bravo!

	dean

		the team's name is the human beings?

	chang

		what is that?

		this is spanish 101. I know how to say "hello," "tomorrow," And that tables are female. That's the only spanish you taught us.

		dirty?

		no.

		Me too.

	vaughn

		Hey, you two.

		Well, that's a cool shirt.

		Where's it from?

		Oh, that's nice.

		See ya.

	buddy

		No, we don't think we're cool at all.

		Hello.

	vaughan

		No.



Speaker: vaughn

	britta

		Hey, britta, hi. What's up?

		No worries.

		I asked politely, and then panda took his pants off.

		And panda has no pants.

		Up top, sugar bear.

		Carrots.

		I'm sorry I can't accept your apology 'cause you're toxic, Britta. You're like the exact opposite of an antioxidant. I got band practice. Lates.

		If you don't like my song, you don't have to listen, all right? I'm an artist and I write what I feel. And I feel that you suck.

	shirley

		Hey.

		Thank you. Thank you very much.

		Oh, uh, i don't even know. I guess it's-- Well, uh-- Hey, look at that. "Hanes classic."

		You know, people underestimate the elderly, You know, but you see these guys out there And they're throwing the bee And they're just loving life. It's just inspiring.

		All right. I am gonna go check on britts. See ya.

	all

		Saying good-bye to Britta was the hardest thing to do. But when someone's a bitch and a liar, there ain't nothing left to woo. I'm getting rid of Britta. What am I doing?	 I'm getting rid of the b.

		I'm getting rid of Britta, I'm getting rid of the b.

		Pierce, I don't need you in my band. I don't need your heart or your hand. I am my own person, and, Pierce, you're a b. Yeah, you heard me say it. Pierce, you're a b.

	pierce

		I know Britta's your friend, but my song is more important.

		Maybe. Assuming to "Garfunkel" someone is to keep putting up with them even though they're a fat, lazy cat who hogs the spotlight and eats lasagna.

		What? Why?

		My band, my song! You want that? How you like that?

		No worries, man. I've moved on. Lates!

		Well payed Pierce. This isn't over.

	jeff

		Hey, hi, what's up, man? I am vaughn.

		Oh, no, no, no. We're just, uh, we're just chillin'. Hey, you're not gonna order coffee?

		Hey, no judgment, bro. I used to do coffee. Then i made the switch to green tea. It's, like--It's, like, Filled with these antioxidants and stuff.

		It's pretty tight.

		There it is.

		Ultimate frisbee at the senior's center. It is amazing.

		Aw, man, if i had a nickel For every time i wished somebody asked me that.

		You know, people underestimate the elderly, You know, but you see these guys out there And they're throwing the bee And they're just loving life. It's just inspiring.

		All right. I am gonna go check on britts. See ya.



Speaker: nurse

	troy

		East lawn. Perfect. This a date? You'll need these.

	annie

		Okay. Two young students. Think I've been to this dance before. You guys are sexual partners, right?

		Doesn't seem to be anything wrong with you.

		Where does it hurt?

		Okay, we have to quarantine you. We got to get you to a safe distance.

		No, we... We have to observe you overnight. It's policy. We don't want another "Vanessa Parsons" on our hand. She was the "typhoid mary" of herpes. I'm kind of the hawkeye around here so it's kind of a... Are you seeing anybody?

		Why is everybody wearing tape over their mouth?

		I'm not ready to die.

		This song goes out to annie.

		for believing in me. * standing in the bookstore line * * waiting for the bell to chime * * so you can go to class * * dancing in your underwear * * taking air conditioner repair *

		* greendale's the way it goes *

		* some things are still the same * * slop pails and pantyhose * * oh, annie believes in me *

		I cannot figure out the voice command part of this thing. It's like my mother

		Let's get this party started!

		Everybody, stay out of the library.

		No, I'm not ready to die!

		Is Jeff out there? He's the only one who can help.

		She's a no-good b.

		She's a gdb.

		I'm Pierce. Yeah. Song's about me.

		great. now i got to start the whole joke over again. Okay, so this guy--

		Somebody help me.

		what up, happy people?

		Classic Rosie.

		Let's get to the movie.

		Hey, that's not fair. I didn't know we started.

		So... Clearly we're all a bunch of funny people. When are we doing this again?

		Well, I was just warming up tonight. Tomorrow you better foam the runways, 'cause I'm bringing my "a" game.

		let's light this candle. Who's ready for some kickpunching?

		My brother died on the set of that movie. One of the mechanical spiders just went haywire and tore him to pieces. Tom Selleck just stood there. He just stood there and... and watched him die.

		Fine! You got me. I did a little advance work. Pathetic? No, I'll tell you what's pathetic... you all sitting there making fun of other people's work. You don't feel good about yourselves, so you have to tear down everything around you. What's the matter? Mama Chang didn't breast-feed?

		You all sicken me! And I will no longer participate in your destructive, negative behavior.

		Biggest laugh of the night.

	doreen

		Hey, honey, say caber-net sauv-a-gong-da-nun.

		Honey, you're boring the crap out of Jeff.

		Well, then, I'm gonna go get us another round.

		Here. Rrrrr... Oh, they already left? What a couple of nincompoops! Uh, before I buy dinner, I have to ask... is there any lovemaking on the table?

	group

		i'm also a toast master, so perhaps I should do the introductions.

		I am a prominent business leader And a highly sought after dinner guest And i will not take courting advice From some teenage boy.

		What does that,

		Big mistake.

		The Dalai Lama and I--

		Sounds good.

		Don't use that word around Abed. In any case, if you want me to have a chat with Jeff, I'd be happy to do it. We've got a bond going, kind of. Sorta like brothers.

		I wonder what this express package could be? Somebody had to get something to me very fast.

		Oh, yes. My ear-Noculars.

		What's that?

		Hey, guys, guys, guys? Annie is talking about some kind of experiment.

		Britta's making the change to green tea.

		That's right. Laugh it up. You guys want to know what they're doing?

		Making fun of all of us.

		He's crying. Now he's barking.

		who do you guys think cheated?

		as far as i'm concerned, there's only one black hole worth studying. it's called sagittarius a, it's located in the center of our galaxy, and it has the density of 40 suns. just like my weiner.

		I lived in my car for a stretch in the '70s. Nothing like bedding a woman on the vinyl backseat of a Skylark. Of course, we didn't have the same safety standards back then so... No condoms. I tell you, before aids, sex was like shaking hands.

		so then the guy says to the housekeeper, "make sure she's dead." Stop me if you heard this one before.

		the housekeeper says to the guy, "we don't have a pool." And the guy says...

		who's that old guy?

		oh, come on!

		what? First, we give a month to black history, Now we're blowing seven days on the irish.

		you know, if senor chang gets any crazier, He's gonna win one of those grammy awards.

		i don't get it.

		what is it, the chair?

		it's all right, i've been divorced seven times. Don't answer your phones And bury all your money in the backyard.

		he gets any nuttier, they're gonna put him on the view.

		what are we gonna do? we gonna study?

		Hey, guys, Jeff and I are double-dating tonight with my new girlfriend.

		No, no, no, that's just her profession. She doesn't escort me. No, no. I met her in my marketing class. And I'm taking Doreen to Annie's mixer tonight.

		Nonsense. Men were wired to fight each other so that women could choose the right mate.

		I'm born-again.

		Yeah, we had a re-birthing ritual in my friend's hot tub. I'm now a level-five laser lotus in my Buddhist community.

		Guess what happened to me.

		I say we keep buddy in the group.

		I've given it a lot of thought, and frankly I like his in-your-face style.

		This is why we need new blood. I'm so bored of you pop culture references And your cigarette-legged jeans.

		Well, say your vote out loud.

		Troy's got a point.

		Listen up. We outnumber this guy six to one. Annie, you flash your breasts as a decoy for the bum rush.

		And that, ladies and gentlemen, Is why I voted to keep him.

		Good morning.

		You thought I was dead, didn't you?

		You people have any idea how emasculating that is? I'm not Mickey Rooney. You don't have to cross your fingers to see if I'll show up. You know, when I was 30, people used to wish that I was dead to my face! That's called respect.

		Well, this is already ridiculous.

		Good Lord. Is she a water pot or a tea kettle?

		Don't you think the flowers are dying from the tea?

		Shh, shh!

		So embarrassing.

		Ooh! Plot twist.

		Culturally, it's unacceptable, but it's theatrical dynamite!

		Then I was gonna say, "it's a good day to be gay."

		his songs are dumber than he is.

		So just to be clear, I don't have a shot with any of you?

	buddy

		I've never seen you before in my life.

		Maybe a little less sugar next time.

	jeff

		are you the board-certified tutor?

		Jeff, it's a pleasure. My name is Pierce Hawthorne and, yes, That is Hawthorne as in Hawthorne wipes, The award-winning moist towellete.

		all right, you already know brittles.

		Abed. Abed the arab. Is that inappropriate?

		roy. roy the wonder boy.

		little princess elizabeth.

		and finally, this beautiful creature is named Shirley.

		pardon you?

		what advances?

		Uh, Jeff, if you have all the answers, why the hell did you start this study group?

		I like you, Jeffrey. You remind me of myself at your age.

		You know, I've been divorced seven times. Sometimes, I think I'm doing something wrong.

		I never looked at it that way.

		Morning, Jeffrey. People were jazzed to see me too.

		Tell you what, you take her. I have less to prove. You can't pursue people so desperately. It starts to creep them out. Why don't we go get a beer? I'll give you some advice, and we can have what the  kids are calling a sausage fest.

		Next time, then.

		Can you believe this? What are the odds?

		That's a nice shirt. Want to sell it?

		What's the moist towelette industry like? Believe me, it's nothing like the product. Nah. It's a hard, dry, large business. Destroyed all my marriages. Of course it didn't help any that  I can't have children. I'm not sterile. In fact, it's a rare condition they call "hyper-virility". Apparently my sperm shoot through the egg like bullets. Can you believe that?

		Hemingway's Lemonade.

		Am I a piece of garbage to you?

		Got ya. Let's have one drink before we work. To the "empowerage" of words.

		So what's up with you, Jeffrey? It seems like you got a burr up your ass or something.

		Forget Britta. ...you have to know is her name. What is she, a water filter? She's ugly.

		What are you doing?

		Oh no no no. This is the first time people are gonna see Winger and Hawthorne together. We are gonna show them we're a force to be reckoned with. Come on, let's brainstorm some story ideas. Better yet, before we do that, let's ask ourselves... What is a story?

		Alright, tell me what I've got so far.

		You're right. Needs more work.

		Okay What do we do about the ending of act two?

		Wait a minute, Wait a minute, Wait a minute. You're bailing on our first sausage fest? This is your definition of friendship?

		That's all you had to say, Jeff.

		Awesome! Look at awesome Jeffrey Winger. Too awesome for old Pierce with your hip shirts, and your gelled hair, and your cool tape over your mouth.

		Oh, good. Cause I know what I'd like to protest... How much you hurt me.

		First, you constantly blow me off, then you want me to do your homework, then you tell me I'm trying too hard to be your friend so you have to go. You have to come out here to pretend to care about the stupid stuff she cares about.

		I'll show you some sperm, buddy. Was this your idea? What the hell? Fire.

		All right.

		Si.

		You did an all right job  up there, my friend.

		A couple of notes You got this thing you do with your face when you're trying to be funny that forces people to think about how cool you think you are.

		I heard you with my own ear...noculars.

		Oh, good. Well, in that case. But if we're gonna do something, let's do it as a team. I will get the ball rolling. Maybe he has a tiny penis.

		Got rid of it. You see, jeff, there are certain things Man was not meant to hear. We were designed, by whatever entity you choose, To hear what's in this range, And really, this range alone. Because you know who's talking to us in this range? The people we love.

		gentlemen... i present to you the greendale human being.

		see, jeff, this is a chart of the features we're staying away from-- pan-asian eye folds, irish chins, women's breasts.

		oh, sorry. hey, say hello to our ethnically neutral mascot-- the greendale human being. the costume makes it difficult for him to see.

		What are you going as? A gay douchebag? Just kidding.

		I know, you're not much of a liking the ladies guy either, huh? Oop. Body blow. Is that liquor?

		I'm old? What do you mean old? Whose hands are these? Help me!

		I'm gonna crush myself to death with desks and tables, Jeff!

		I never saw Beastmaster. I just wanted to be cool.

		Those floating Mexican skeletons were right. My life is over.

		I'm old, Jeff.

		well, I do have a young, African-American friend.

		Yeah?

		Yeah!

		Jeff, she's right there.

		by the way, jeff, i think your shirt's trying To get out of your pants.

		yeah, go tongue chang.

		what kind of a person is asked to help other people And then helps himself!

		heh. and i had a great sandwich.

		uh, we're the best.

		i know your secret. I know about the chair.

		Jeff... you and I are friends, right?

		You may have noticed a recent change in my demeanor.

		Well, I have a new girlfriend. And she is super smart, if you know what I mean.

		Can't wait for you to meet her. You know, when you catch a big fish, you want to stuff her and put her on the mantle. How 'bout tonight?

		So, Jeff, dust off that black book and rustle up a honey, huh?

		Well, I guess it is pretty short notice. Probably couldn't get a date anyway.

		You know, I wonder, Jeffrey, for all your feather flashing, when was the last time you actually scored?

		Oh, hello, Jeffrey.

		I was just going into the fair to wait for my smokin'-hot date.

		How 'bout you? Were you ever able to, you know, come up with a, you know, date?

		Don't worry about it, kid. What you're going through is a dry spell. From my experience, they don't last any more than 12, 13 years.

		Excuse me.

		Yeah.

		Oh, you must have a great personality.

		Congratulations, Jeff. You proved me wrong. You got a girl.

		Oh, this is Doreen. Ready for our double date?

		Hey, look how gorgeous Doreen is tonight. Hey, can we... Let's lay out our plans for the evening. You wing man me, I wing man you. Maybe we split up for a little hoo-ha. And then meet in the morning for eggs and... details.

		You know, Doreen speaks six languages. You should hear her order wine in French.

		Well, then, I'm gonna go get us another round.

		There he is. Back already. Detail time?

		Oh, it's not Greendale, Jeff, it's you. You're becoming more mature. I mean, a man reaches a point in his life where he stops looking for a place to hang his underwear and starts looking for a place to hang his hat.

		Oh, uh, she said if I wanted to continue the night I'd have to pay.

		Oh, no, it was a wake-up call. Doreen's a very special lady. I did not treat her right. I have stuff to work on, you know?

		We're both gonna get there. Here's to being better men.

		So could I borrow 200 bucks?

		You know, for 220 I can get the...

		Ooh, I can get it twice. Ah, college. Best years of our lives.

		So what's the deal, Jeff? You leave your stones in your other suit? Why didn't you rap that guy in the face?

		Agnostic... lazy man's atheist.

		Well, I aced it, amigo. That means "cousin".

		I know guys like this Mike. He used to be a nerd. Now he's a meathead. Dangerous combo. Tyson, Lou Ferrigno, Rosie O'Donnell.

		Are you telling me you've never been punched in the face?

		Every man should be punched in the face. It's a rite of passage. In my day, Friday night was smoke a doobie, feel up a gal, and then get your teeth knocked out by a republican.

		All right, I've seen enough. Let's see what we're working with. Go ahead, throw a few at the old paws. What are you, a North Korean seamstress?

		Get mad! Come on! If it helps, think of me as somebody who annoys you. Ooh, that's it! That's... that's good.

		Boys, this is not a game. You gotta be ready for anything.

		You're welcome!

		Jeffrey, you're a man now. How's it feel?

		Some people just don't know how to say thank you.

		Good to hear you admit it, jeff.

		He throws off our balance. We've got three chicks, three dudes, And now two weirdos.

		It's exactly the way I would have done it, jeff.

		Oh, my third wife was biracial.

		That's ridiculous. Obviously, it's a guy.

		Thank you.

		Hey! Could you open the back door?

		Well, Jeff, you've taken a big step in knocking down the barriers between students and teachers... Just like Rosa Parks.

		No, it's just like that.

		Jerry Rice? Oh, God. I liked him.

		Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh!

	movie

		Freeze police? Don't do that. They'll get cold.

		"Directed by Kim Yang." Asian... Can't direct, can't drive.

		Change? Time to change the channel. This guy's gonna be begging for change, he keeps making movies this bad. They should change this movie to something good. I wish this crap-apillar would change into a butterfly and fly away. That's change we can believe in.

		"Ass-burger".

		What?

		Oh...

		No, Abed!

		That is "girl" for "talk to Vaughn".

		oh, an email.

		"PC-ness."

		Tell it to the birthday cake you never got.

		Tea for two? There... there're five people.

	extra

		That is a pretty big discount.

	dean

		thank you, dean, thank you.

		well, we are missing a pipsqueak, but we don't want one, so beat it.

		sorry. just my luck.

		oh, i can help you with that, your honor. i have a wealth of experience in image management, icon development, and y2k preparedness.

		that's no problem. by the way, i took the liberty of thumbnailing a human being prototype which i modeled after da vinci's vitruvian man. the penis is a little small, i think.

		so...black?

		okay. fill me in later.

		gentlemen... i present to you the greendale human being.

		i think if we add in a little bit of phylicia rashad we'll be in better shape.

		ooh! i left the nose in the kiln.

		here it is. still hot.

		oh, dean, i'm gonna get some more coffee. you want anything?

		la bamba. got it.

		we've solved racism. what's next?

		little albinos.

	troy

		hey.

		No, no, no, come on. Bears have feet.

		You little twerp.

		I forgive you.

		He's good, isn't he?

		That's funny. You know, Jeff probably comes late so he doesn't have to sit through all of your tardiness.

		You realize these conversations are due in the morning. Don't you?

		Hacks.

		she's not?

		i've seen men in your situation, Troy. No, those are both for me. You were on top of the world before And now no one gives a rat's ass. I can help you with your image. First, lose the jacket. You look like a high school bitch. But more importantly, it's your sneeze. When i was a ceo, I had an array of masculine sneezes That asserted dominance. You know, like, the explosive, Shock-the-room-into-silence sneeze. Or the draw-them-in sneeze. You know... And maybe i wouldn't sneeze because i'm in control. You could even use a sneeze to drive home a point even. Like, i think-- i think the cubs Are going to win it all this year. What do you think?

		No, no, no, no, no. This is my cell phone headset. And this is ear-Noculars. It's for spies and whatnot. It gives you sonic hearing.

		i don't.

		all right, guys, are we gonna do this thing?

		If this stands for "What would Billy Joel do", I'll tell you right now... he'd write another crappy song.

		Oh, then it's settled. We have to teach Jeffrey how to fight. I know a few moves.

		Troy, I assume you're handy with a switchblade.

		Well, that foxy Black girl thinks it is.

		You know, there's an old Buddhist saying in my vision group...

		You traitors! I'm appalled that your lack of loyalty. Yeah, you better run

		Troy! What you did up there really took guts. I'm impressed.

		Yeah. And such a creative way to tell the world you're gay.

		What? You think I'm too old to make monkeyshines at a picture show? Come on. I'm younger than the three of you put together.

		Maybe I'm just that brilliant.

	abed

		there's breakfast?

		Soup?

		Sorry, Abed.

		What, Hippies?

		You realize these conversations are due in the morning. Don't you?

		Hacks.

		or a family dinner.

		shut up, boo-boo head.

		Yes, I am.

		Fantastic.

		Heard stories about it, yeah.

		Look, I really don't need your advice, and I'm not your pantsless grandpa.

		i'd rather die than listen.

		i'd like to exterminate this conversation.

		all right, guys, are we gonna do this thing?

		Still waiting on those cookies, Abed.

		Oh, then it's settled. We have to teach Jeffrey how to fight. I know a few moves.

		Abed, you get back to the family tent, try to find a chicken for Jeff to Chase.

		Sorry, abed.

		You traitors! I'm appalled that your lack of loyalty. Yeah, you better run

		What time do you want us there?

		What? You think I'm too old to make monkeyshines at a picture show? Come on. I'm younger than the three of you put together.

		What? No, no, you can't do that. We just watched kickpuncher. We have to see kickpuncher 2. I have so many unanswered questions.

		What do you mean? I'm making jokes during the movie.

		Maybe I'm just that brilliant.

		That in itself is a laugh. I know I'm funny. I don't need any of you people to validate me.

	comedyclub

		All right, guys, you hear that pause right after he says, "and a good day"? What do you got for me there?

		I don't get it.

		Oh, buzz, how many times can you keep going to that well?

		Come on, guys. I'm starting to wonder if you even deserve to call yourselves a community college sketch comedy troupe. I told you, on movie night, I need to blow these punks out of the water. I need Phyllis Diller-grade stuff.

		What are you, my third wife's therapist?

		You're a genius.

		What?

		Don't flatter yourselves.

	annie

		If it's so serious, why don't they call it meningitis?

		Uh-Huh. Calling me "hacky sack" And ripping my--My six pack abs and my moist hair.

		are you a musician?

		well, i guess that's your fault, isn't it?

		you've got an accomplished Pianist and songwriter sitting 3 feet away from you. I wrote the jingle For hawthorne wipe's moist towelettes. I would have done your song for free. Smooth move, metamucil.

		yo.

		well, that's more like it.

		this friday? this friday?

		no, no, no! You really don't know much about genius, do you? Yes, i can do it by friday.

		i know!

		hi, almost done.

		you can tell the dean i'll have a song That'll make the devil poop god's pants.

		well, uh, yeah, sure. I, uh--i'll probably open with something like this. uh... You know, a note like that. And end with a note like that. Uh, the words, i can't tell you. You know, the rest is really a surprise.

		a musician sees music in everything, annie. I mean, it could be... * moo shoo pork * * squab with lettuce * * You see? i mean, it just comes out. You know what? you really shouldn't be here right now.

		you are inside a throbbing, cosmic womb Of creativity, And when this baby starts kicking, I cannot be responsible for your sanity. i know it sounds funny, But let me play you out, okay? Playing you out now, this song. You know, like on stage? playing you out, okay? Thanks for coming. bye-bye.

		I'm a fraud, annie.

		oh, yeah, yeah, sure, the haw-- You want to hear it? here. * you'll be wiping off that ketchup * * with our wipes, hawthorne wipes! * * you'll be wiping off that mustard * * with our wipes at the picnic! *

		i know! i steal everything. You backed the wrong horse. i got nothing.

		well, you shouldn't. i quit.

		the way it goes. That's it.

		oh, sorry. hey, say hello to our ethnically neutral mascot-- the greendale human being. the costume makes it difficult for him to see.

		Oh, I thought I shouted you the response from the phone here. Access email

		Not me. I could do this all night. I love you

		And Annie knows a thing or two about guilt. Am I right, Jew?

		Jewie?

		No, I became even cooler. These ironic tee shirts are all the rage.

		What?

		That doesn't mean you're not having sex.

	starburns

		You know, the usual cool stuff. I've got 'ludes, uh, dreamers... Johnny boys.

		I don't know, Starburns. I'm...

		Hey, hey, who said you weren't? Saddle up, fruit pie.

		Hey, uh, man? What'd you slip me? I keep grinding my teeth, and I want to kiss everybody.

		Have you decided?

		I don't pop in video. Let me do the song in person. Getting rid of Britta. Getting rid of the B. She's the GDB. She's a... no good B

	britta

		His words, not mine.

		okay, grandpa.

		well, i may be a genius, but i'm not a lesbian.

		are you kidding?

		I am the Beastmaster. From the movie Beastmaster. What rock have you been living under?

		Vaughn? The guy with the tiny nipples you did it with.

		Let me talk to him for you. Man-to-man is better. We won't think about our chubby thighs or whether or not we can have babies.

		Your hormones are clouding your...

		Brittles, I forgot to tell you, I went and talked to Vaughn. The bad news is I could not patch up things between you. You really did a number on him. Good news is I'm the new keyboardist in his band.

		You're missing the headline. I'm in a rock band!

		Oh, yeah, totally.

		have you thought about hypnotherapy? I know a dynamite hypnotherapist.

		his name is pierce hawthorne. And i'm very effective.

		you would? super. i'll set it up.

		and i appreciate the opportunity. You know, sometimes, i think People don't take me seriously.

		Just checking the time. Now close your eyes. Keep them closed at all times. And listen to the soothing sound of my voice. The only word that will bring you out Is gorilla. Okay, now focus on the rhythm Of your own breathing. And when you feel the desire To light up a cigarette, You will associate these urges With things in your life that disgust you. Bad-tasting food. Sex with men. Wearing attractive clothing. And soon... Oh, god, i think i really hurt myself!

		Oh, britta, wake up! Why'd i put you under so well? Damn my talent.

		the next time you even see a cigarette, You will think of things that disgust you. And while you're under so deep, You'll find yourself attracted To slightly older men. Perhaps, some barrel-chested stud With just enough tummy to love. You'll want to buy him dinner, Then go back to his hot tub. Perhaps, you'll invite one of your friends To join us for a three-way. Maybe someone with low self-esteem And slightly larger breasts.

		a-ha!

		i know. I saw you. What do you think i am, some kind of a joke?

		how dare you pity me? I may be a little older, My ideas may seem weird, And my fashion sense may cause envy. But i have a lot to offer. And i will not be pitied. Do not help me up.

		yes. i did?

		ah! who's the third?

		all right, dial it back a little, britta.

		That guy wasn't gay. He had a moustache.

		Just by asking me that question, you've put me back down to a level four. You now owe me 2,000 Energon cubes.

		Britta, put your blouse back on.

		Where should I put my Buddha incense holder?

		Suck it, Nietzsche!

		Don't be upset. I didn't pick you as a decoy 'cause your breasts are so old.

	shirley

		sexually harassing? what? That makes no sense to me. Why would i harass somebody who turns me on?

		If it's so serious, why don't they call it meningitis?

		you know, i was really moved by your honesty earlier. Particularly the part about your husband Not being able, you know...

		And that face you made? Well, i think it's pretty obviously annie.

		Oh, good. Well, in that case. But if we're gonna do something, let's do it as a team. I will get the ball rolling. Maybe he has a tiny penis.

		Message received

		This is a real barn-burner. God, did i just say cross-burner?

		oh, good.

		i can help you with that.

		yawn!

		no. Do you know anybody who reads from cards? No, you don't, and that's why. Also you might consider a darker top.

		oh, and  Don't--don't, uh, lock your knees. Never lock your knees. You know what happens when you lock your knees? You die. Second, When you want to drive home a point, Hand them a sandwich. Try it. hand them a sandwich.

		yeah, except you just dropped, uh, the sandwich, As opposed to handing it to them.

		right. so yeah. And try attention-grabbing words to wake up the audience Such as, uh, "multiple orgasm."

		yeah, and about these filler words of yours. I mean, nobody wants to buy brownies from somebody who says, "um," and "like." I have a method for fixing that. start from the top.

		uh!

		uh!

		like!

		whatever, valley girl.

		best closer to a presentation, a nicholson quote. Uh, you take a phrase from one of his films And you tailor it to your product. You can't handle a moist towelette! Something like that, you know? But you can't use that one. that's--that's mine.

		sure.

		okay. Just don't let anybody know i was involved.

		I told him not to fight. He wouldn't listen. I don't know what that is.

		Shirley, don't embarrass yourself. I'm sure they don't want to invite a housewife.

		What? You think I'm too old to make monkeyshines at a picture show? Come on. I'm younger than the three of you put together.

		Oh, I'm sorry, Shirley. I'll wait if you want to serve beverages.

		Check your email.

		Who the hell is Pam?

	chang

		What? Did you say S?

		why doesn't annie have to write it?

		Actually, uh, that was my present to Jeff.

		Did you say "s"?

	vaughn

		All right, hold on here. Can I have a word with you? Could you come here, please, for a second? What'd you say?

		Your song. We wrote it together. Are you trying to Garfunkel me?

		I get it. You're jealous.

		I don't know. Because when I were these skinny jeans, my ass looks like a baby pumpkin. Or because I'm not a small-nippled, credit-hogging jag who only knows three power cords.

		You get on that horse.

		Vaughn, I just want you to know, I haven't changed my mind. I am out. Also, do me a favor, will you lay off Britta? She may walk like she just got off a horse, but underneath all that clown makeup, she's a good kid.

		Lates. Okay. Snakes. What?

	humanbeing

		great idea. let's do it!

	vaughan

		We're through, Pierce. I'm gonna go to the bar, and you can join me if you'd like. And we can still have a lovely evening. But it will cost you 200 bucks.

	jeff

		Well, I did have a client who owned a vineyard in Napa. He was into S&M and Merlot, so we called it S&M&M.

		They're in the shop. You know, despite what most people think, I actually spend most of my time talking. As men get older, they want to spend their time with someone they can have a real conversation with.

		"Going to", Jeff? Look, Sabrina's cute, but she thinks that Monty Python is the evil snake from Harry Potter.

		You can do better.

		death... So-called... Is a thing that makes men weep. And yet a third of life is spent In sleep. Open your textbooks to page 37. Now...close them and throw them away. Throw it away! Throw it away! For those of you who are new, The motto of this class: carpe diem. "seize the day!" No tests! no papers. You want an "a"? Live in... The moment.

		take off your shoes. Quick. take off your shoes. everyone, take your shoes off. Throw them away. Throw them across the room over there. Today, we learn to walk! Get up and walk out the door! This day could be your last!

		day seized. Only when we stop stopping our lives Can we begin to start starting them. Ms. Edison here, for example, would rather write About what happens to other people Than live what is happening to her.

		Get up on your desk. Come on. stand on your desk. Up on your desk. She made it! ha ha! Everyone stand on your desks! Up, up, up, up, up! come on. Rise, rise, rise above the programming. All your lives you were told don't stand on your desks. Well, why not?

	jeff

		You are new.

		i like it!

		Mr. winger, can i have a word, please?

		hi. Mr. winger, i like to think that every life That passes through this class is changed. But every year, there's always one cocky opportunist Who's just here to coast and grab an easy "a."

		It's actually you, mr. winger. You have no intention of seizing the day.

		well, i'm glad to hear it. Because if you don't genuinely seize the day Before the end of the week, Then you will be seizing an "f" for the semester.

		boo. an ordinary coffee for an ordinary life.

		sorry, mr. winger, these won't cut it.

		sloppy. And considering the age of these girls, Unwittingly creepy.

		had i not already cried at the sunrise this morning, I would be weeping right now.

		what do you mean, Jeff? What does your life mean? How long does it take you in the morning To--to make it look like you have bed head? How many sweat pants, sport jacket combos did you try Before you found the one that said "i don't care"? Seize the day, Jeff, for real. Go running naked in a hailstorm, Kiss a girl in the middle of the day, Fly a kite, but do it for yourself. Or you won't just fail my class, You'll fail life.

		day seized!

		"a" plus, winger. I know a life-changing kiss when i see one. Wowee! ha ha!

	jeff

		i'm only half-arabic, actually. My dad is palestinian. He's a u.s. citizen. He's not a threat to national security or anything. A lot of people want to know that after they meet him, because he has an angry energy. But not, like, angry at america. Just angry at my mom for leaving him. Although she did leave because he was angry and he was angry because she's american. My name's Abed, by the way.

		oh, uh, 5 after 11:00 when you asked.

		yeah?

		well, i only talked to her once While she was borrowing a pencil, but, Her name is Britta, she's 28, birthday in october, She has two older brothers and one of 'em Works with children who have a disorder I might want to look up. Oh, and she thinks she's gonna flunk Tomorrow's test, so she really needs to focus So she's sorry if that makes her seem cold.

		that's the nicest thing anyone's ever said to me.

		Britta invited me. is that cool?

		cool.

		cool, cool, cool. Cool, cool, cool. hey, this is kind of like breakfast club, huh?

		yeah. i'm sure we've each got an issue balled up inside of us  that would make us cry if we talked about it.

		well, i got a little doozy in the chamber if things get emotional.

		Oh. hey, text message. Let's give this bad boy a read.

		I've never got one of these

		"say you have to pee. i need to talk to you."

		"say you have to pee. I need to talk to you."

		no.

		that's so weird.

		does it say you have to pee?

		not sure. But i invited more people from spanish class. Is that cool? 

		Nobody puts baby in the corner.

		This?

		This isn't like Breakfast Club anymore. Now it's like Stripes or Meatballs. Anything with Bill Murray, really.

		You know, I thought you were like Bill Murray in any of his films, but you're more like Michael Douglas in any of his films.

		Yeah.

		I'm sorry I called you Michael Douglas and I see your value now.

		Good entrance.

		Actually, there's nothing...

		You want me to bring your car around, Jeff?

		No.

		I don't want your money. I want your shirt.

		I've had my eye on it since registration day.

		I don't think you understand. I want to wear it out of here.

		What are you guys doing?

		It's a silent protest. Lots of candles. Gets the ladies in the mood for social  change. If you know what I mean. Good chance to put some miles on this shirt.

		not a fan. In every movie, there's an authority figure That gets mad at him for making people laugh.

		oh, can't.

		actually, i'm doing a movie about my dad.

		yeah.

		i'll have to make some adjustments to my film. Jeff, i think you should play the role of my father.

		that's perfect. you already know your lines.

		Cool tie, Jeff. Are you wearing that Because you're playing the role of my dad, Or is it really christmas?

		And, Jeff, let me get you something.

		can we get sued?

		well, that's sort of my gimmick. but we did lean on that pretty hard last week. i can lay low for an episode.

		There's a storm building on the horizon, but you and I will save the night. Chex mix, pretzels, baby carrots, predictable but appetizing.

		Jeff, you must return to Annie's party. She's feeling unpopular.

		Way to go. I know I'm not Batman. You could try not being a jerk.

		Yeah?

		If I stay, there can be no party.

		Stay with me. My room has a bunk bed, which is a misnomer because it's the real deal.

		Yeah. Cool. You want the top or the bottom bunk?

		Me too. Race you for it I win.

		Jeff, did I say anything in my sleep about farm animals or Brian Williams?

		Cool. Cool cool cool. Lucky charms?

		Sometimes I like to pour hot cocoa mix into cold milk and drink like it like a cold hot chocolate. I call it "special drink".

		You're Goldie Hawn, Jeff.

		You're Goldie Hawn.

		No. In overboard, she was just like you. Wealthy, assertive, arrogant. Got manicures all the time. But she fell off her boat, good thing for her because, she realized she was happier being poor and rising four boys with Kurt Russell.

		Do whatever you want. You just have to know what that is. For me, it's Lucky Charms... and tv.

		Really great to have somebody to watch stuff with. My dad never wanted to watch anything so I was kind of raised by tv.

		Cop Rock. That sounds cool.

		Cool.

		You look like you moved out.

		Yep.

		You're a huge nerd.

		is there a rat in here?

		it's true.

		Troy and I played basketball. It was fun.

		You got it.

		What religion are you, Jeff?

		So what's my role going to be in the fight? Is there a key moment where I finally stand up for myself and take revenge on the villain?

		Yeah I will. In his face!

		You've never been in a fight?

		You're like hawkeye on m.A.S.H. He kept his upbeat humor and charm Even in the 11th year of the korean war.

		Jeff, I need to take your picture. We got it.

		This character reboot is really gelling for you, jeff. That was all classic hawkeye. Sending soldiers out for liquor. Slyly sidestepping the problematic scrutiny Of annie "hot lips" edison. I should build you a still for making hawkeye martinis.

		Call me radar.

		Not all weirdos are bad. But he might be a puckish agent of change That changes our lives for the better Through a musical montage.

		Thank you.

		You lied about the guy in seattle With the meat tenderizer. You put your thumb on the scale. But you did it with a smile, And you did it so you could keep smiling. You're hawkeye.

		Okay.

		Jeff, what's your favorite episode of M.A.S.H.?

		That's what I thought. If you'd ever actually seen the show, You'd know that hawkeye doesn't just bed nurses And drink martinis. He also had blood sprayed on his face And barked orders when the choppers came in. If he didn't, people died. He was a leader, jeff. That's your job.

		Ooh, you made me so happy I just peed a little.

		I did. Several times, actually, but he never returned my calls.

		Yes. I do like macaroni.

	troyactor

		Uh, just have fun with it. Take 36.

	starburns

		Yeah

		Discoteca, muneca, la biblioteca

		Alright

	thug

		They're for my friends. There's a lot of other cookies left.

		He's doing this for me. He's my bodyguard.

	troy

		Hola, mi llamo Abed

		Donde esta la biblioteca?

		Gracias

		Conflicts like these will ultimately bring us together as an unlikely family.

		yes, he was.

		No! This is krumping.

		[Imitates a stoner] Oh, i think it's time For burning man.

		[Imitates a stoner] Nice to meet you, dude.

		[Imitates woman] - Ooh, wow. I love reading and being a desperate housewife.

		it's probably arabic.

		oh, hey. troy. I didn't see you. Um, how long were you standing there?

		yes, that's what i was doing. You got me. I was just messing with you, but i guess i blew it again.

		whoa, whoa, whoa. I'm not an alien.

		yeah.

		this is what friends do.

		cool.

		cool. bam bam!

		we went over-budget.

		36, you win! Best of three

		Hey.

		Yeah.

		You're a very attractive young man.

		You sound like cookie monster.

		That's Batman.

		Yeah, it sure does.

		Look out.

		All day.

		What is?

		You would eat yourself?

		That'd be tasty.

		Yeah.

		you don't have to worry, troy. It's just a movie. I can't predict the future.

		i don't know. They're just trying to do what they're gonna do.

		Troy, sing. The assignment is to train a rat to respond to a specific song.

		hmm?

		he did it!

		Commencing reward. i have to open the cage.

		troy?

		troy?

		because fievel's going to die.

		i thought you might want to help me out Because we are friends.

		i would face my fears to help you.

		am i? * somewhere * * out there *

		* beneath the pale... *

		thank you.

		it's the tsunami 3000 anniversary edition. You?

		i'll take the northeast. Northeast is closest to the drinking fountain--

		No.

		I'm trying to reduce my pop-cultural referencing.

		Sounds fun.

		You want my stuffed animal?

		Oh, like Stallone in over the top. But I'm not sure of all the rules. Don't I need a semi truck and a ten-year-old son?

		Uh, I want to wait for a more inspiring song. This score isn't right. There we go.

		I don't like those apples. I'm so upset. It was just a fluke I won those other games.

		But you didn't say anything.

		You're a really good friend.

		Okay.

		The characteristic of an acid to donate or accept a proton cannot be quantified for individual species, comparing two donor acceptor systems, the proton transposition H8 plus H20...

		Yeah Troy?

		Sure.

		So you're like a Muslim. Salaam alaikum.

		She's got a point. You know, in boxing, you fight for the purse and the belt.

		Oh Christmas Troy, oh Christmas Troy, thy candles shine so brightly. Oh Christmas Troy, oh Christmas Troy, much pleasure thou canst give me.

		Don't move

		You go, girl.

		Hi, guys. That was really cool. I wish I knew how to tap-dance.

		Annie.

		Pierce.

		Brita.

		Troy.

		Thank you.

		I don't know.

		I love The Big Lebowski.

		Kickpuncher, starring don "the demon" Donaldson as a cyborg cop whose punches have the power of kicks.

		Cool.

		Actually, if she doesn't mind reinforcing the stereotype, I bet Shirley would have fun talking smack at a movie.

		Hey, guys.

		Hey, I hope you don't mind. I invited senor Chang. We're Netflix friends.

		They're just jealous.

		I am Punchkicker. Meet your match.

		I love you, kickpuncher.

		I asked her. She wasn't available. Let's go film the sex scene.

	shirley

		Can i read it?

		I know you're a sweet, christian, generous person. oh, that's nice.

		i also know you have thinly veiled rage issues.

		careful, boy.

		that's my newspaper.

		shirley, i have no psychic abilities. I'm just an entertainer. But if it'll make you feel any better, Here, let me show you what i'm working on.

		yeah. and that's how you'd behave in that situation, no?

		mm-hmm.

		mm-hmm. yeah.

		shirley, i don't have powers. trust me. In my next film, we discover that pierce is an actual genius.

		no, it's not.

		thanks.

		the dean says the exterminator is coming Because of our rat.

		It's a traditional Muslim dish.

		Hi.

		Yeah. We make fun of 'em.

		Actually, if she doesn't mind reinforcing the stereotype, I bet Shirley would have fun talking smack at a movie.

		Care to join us?

		Hey, guys.

		Hey, I hope you don't mind. I invited senor Chang. We're Netflix friends.

	britta

		cool, cool, cool. Cool, cool, cool. hey, this is kind of like breakfast club, huh?

		yeah. i'm sure we've each got an issue balled up inside of us  that would make us cry if we talked about it.

		Oh. hey, text message. Let's give this bad boy a read.

		I've never got one of these

		"say you have to pee. i need to talk to you."

		"say you have to pee."

		Yeah?

		You look like Elisabeth Shue.

		What did he say?

		Spoilers.

		i'm interested in making movies. But my dad says all media's western propaganda That negatively stereotypes arabs.

		mm.

		$70.

		this is really nice of you.

		it's cool. our first assignment is a documentary. They're like real movies, but with ugly people. I'm learning a lot.

		he says "we're leaving."

		i don't think i'm really in the scene.

		good. my film is coming together.

		yeah.

		It's more expensive, But it lets me adjust really specific settings That most people don't notice or think about.

		my movie's more important.

		'cause this is the scene where you leave.

		i'm finished.

		Britta, Jeff, dad.

		yeah.

		well, Britta, it isn't called friend business, It's called show business.

		We're having the time of our lives.

		Shadowy flight into the world of a man who does not exist. Britta, may I have a word?

		You need to take Jeff back.

		He's like E.T. He crashed in my place. And we're friends now, it's great for me, but it's bad for him. He needs to get back.

		Use your lady parts.

		Don't be naive. The charge between you was keeping him going. Tell him you'll make love to him if he takes a shower and finds a nice place to live.

		Do it. Seduce him. Draw the tapeworm of Jeff out of him with your sexuality.

		Then say good-bye to E.T.

		Have you guys seen a rat? Troy knocked over fievel's cage and he escaped.

		try to join the rest of us in reality, britta.

		he's sitting in jeff's chair, So he's trying to act like jeff.

		She's got a point. You know, in boxing, you fight for the purse and the belt.

		I get 72 virgins in heaven.

		Well, you're not a typically vulnerable or feminine person, and the act of dancing is considered both vulnerable and feminine.

		Hi, guys. That was really cool. I wish I knew how to tap-dance.

		Mm, pass.

	abeddad

		i'm finished.

		Britta, Jeff, dad.

	vaughan

		Yeah.

	abedalien

		greetings, commander.

		well, he is rather arrogant And has no mercy for weaker beings.

	group

		this is getting way more like breakfast club now.

		You know what I got for Christmas? It was a banner year at the Bender family. I got a carton of cigarettes. The old man grabbed me, he said, "Hey, smoke up, Johnny!" "No, dad! What about you?"

		I can't feel my,

		What's going on? Can you guys hear me? Am I deaf? Can you hear me talking right now?

		That's good.

		I like it, it makes every ten minutes feel like the beginning of a new scene of a tv show. Of course, the illusion only lasts until someone says something they'd never say on tv like, how much their life is like tv. There, it's gone.

		Good studying. See you later. Bye.

		My dad will only pay for classes That will help me run the family restaurant. It's been struggling since 2001. 9/11 was pretty much the 9/11 of the falafel business.

		the memo says "for dreams."

		perfect. that's a wrap.

		troy could do the school song. Troy invited rap music, And he's related to danny glover and president obama.

		pierce and troy didn't get along at first, but now they're bonding through mutual adolescence.

		will they or won't they? sexual tension.

		i know what you're gonna say. You watched my movies on the website.

		no, i'm not a witch. I'm a student of human character. I know you guys all so well I can predict your behavior. like shirley.

		here. check this out. May i?

		jeff's character acts Like nothing around here affects him. But things bother him more than he lets on.

		he's also very vain.

		it's a gambit.

		the reason it's taking so long is because troy's afraid--

		that's very funny.

		Jeff protected my honor. It was like my bodyguard, but I was the kid from meatballs, Jeff was the guy from full metal jacket, and the moustache guy was the brother of the guy on entourage.

		I'm Muslim.

		You can drive anywhere.

		You could do your taxes.

		You could even enroll in community college.

		I've seen buddy before. He sits in the corner next to the dead plant.

		I saw that coming.

		I like his idea of ironically saying "you go, girl."

		Well, in the right stuff, the novel by tom wolfe--

		Secret vote. Everybody cover your eyes.

		When you guys first came in, we were as wholesome and healthy as the family in the Brady bunch. And now we're as dysfunctional and incestuous as the cast of the Brady bunch.

		Do you guys hear that?

	duncan

		m.a.s.h.

		I must have missed that.

	garrett

		* somewhere * * out there * * beneath the pale moonlight *

		* someone's * * thinking of me * * and loving me tonight *

		* it helps to think we might be wishing *

		* on the same bright star *

		* and when the night wind starts to sing *

		* a lonesome lullaby *

		* it helps to think we're sleeping *

		* underneath that same big sky *

		* somewhere *

		* if love can see us through *

		* then we'll be together *

		* somewhere out there *

		* out where dreams *

	fiebel

		fievel? Fievel? Fievel? fievel.

	slater

		Yeah.

		Well, Jeff acts as sort of the dad of the group, so emotionally this is kind of like being told that you're our new mom.

		Absolutely. Do you cook macaroni?

		Macaroni's my favorite.

	pierce

		sure.

		What are you guys doing?

		It's a silent protest. Lots of candles. Gets the ladies in the mood for social  change. If you know what I mean. Good chance to put some miles on this shirt.

		All hearing is sonic.

		Yeah.

		Taking a pill?

		Xenolovaden. My grandpa took that when he was around your age.

		But by the time grandpa got up in years, his memory wasn't great. He'd mix the wrong pills. You know how old people are?

		One time he started hallucinating and ran down the street with no pants on. Which in the Gaza Strip is considered a real party foul, so you should probably be careful...

		Hence aids.

		seriously, this hardly seems like a fair fight.

		Troy and I played basketball. It was fun.

		Why don't you like my tight jeans?

		I did.

		Actually, if she doesn't mind reinforcing the stereotype, I bet Shirley would have fun talking smack at a movie.

		Tomorrow night we're all gonna get together to watch kickpuncher 2: Codename Punchkicker.

		Actually, we decided to watch runaway instead. Tom selleck fights mechanical spiders.

		Okay, obviously something strange is happening here.

		Yeah.

		Yeah, this isn't about us. This is just a deflection because you can't get a genuine laugh.

	rat

	annie

		Ooh, tomorrow? They're showing all four indiana joneses at the vista. I am really looking forward to the first three. I bought a whip.

		Wow, i didn't realize we were really good friends. I figured we were more like chandler and phoebe. They never really had stories together. Sure, i'll do it, chandler.

		Okey-Dokey.

		Cool. See ya.

		Oh, gotcha.

		Yeah.

		Yeah, i was livid.

		Because you asked me to stay and you said we were friends.

		Indiana jones. Cool.

		the fourth one blows.

		We're cool.

		Is it under genre or on a specific playlist?

		Have you guys seen a rat? Troy knocked over fievel's cage and he escaped.

		the dean says the exterminator is coming Because of our rat.

		Sounds like a porno with Kate Winslet.

	fievelrat

		good boy, fievel.

	chang

		De nada.

		Got it.

		is there a rat in here?

		el tigre.

		Yes.

	self

		Discoteca, muneca, la biblioteca. Esta en bigotes grandes, el perro, manteca

		Buenos dias, me gusta papas frias, los bigotes de la cabra es Cameron Diaz!

		Yeah boy. Boy.

		What? It's 2009.

		Beginning transmission. The primary purpose seems to be male bonding, And the attitude during conveyance Of the random deceit is apparently of great importance. The humanoid is approximately 5'10" in height.

		Oh, no.

		I must be out there in the night, staying vigilant. Wherever a party needs to be saved, I'm there. Wherever there are masks, wherever there's tomfoolery and joy, I'm there. But sometimes I'm not, 'cause I'm out in the night, staying vigilant, watching, lurking, running, jumping, hurtling, sleeping... No, I can't sleep. You sleep. I'm awake. I don't sleep. I don't blink. Am I a bird? No. I'm a bat. I am Batman. Or am I? Yes, I am Batman. Happy Halloween.

		shirley.

		fievel.

		Yes!

		Hmm.

		Hmm.

		Mm.

		Oh, boy.

		Agh!

		Aha. Oh!

		Oh!

	buddy

		Hey, buddy.

		The group thought about what you said. We took a vote, and you're in.

		Look at him. It's like christmas morning for the guy. Welcome.

		Hey, buddy, you don't have to worry about them. You're with us now. Come on.

	starburns

		I love the kicks.

		The kicks are the best. He's just got that kind of-- You know when some people have it...



Speaker: annie

	all

		Hi, everyone.

		no! I've never... gotten a zero before.

		Tonight, in the library, I will be hosting a "dia de los muertos" party. Dia de los muertos, or day of the dead, is sometimes refered to as mexican Halloween

		Um, most of you have responded to my e-vite, but some of you remain evasive, so...

		Okay, everyone. I think we can begin. I've got everyone's personalized cookie tombstones, por tradicion, and in a few minutes, we're going to start the dance of the dead... La danza de los muertos.

		Party on.

		Okay, it's time for the "dance of the dead". Everyone form a circle. Lights. Music.

		Now for the first dance, I'd like to invite a very special guest to the floor. Jeff Winger? Jeff? Where's Jeff?

		You know what? I don't want to express myself. I don't want to sit in a room full of people and say the "p" word. I like being repressed. I am totally comfortable being uncomfortable with my sexuality. And maybe, just maybe, if everyone were a little bit more like me, we wouldn't have to have an STD fair.

		By the way, now that I've gotten a good look at one, I don't see what all the fuss was about. A giant thumb in a turtleneck. Whoop-dee-do!

	dean

		troy isn't interested in football anymore. getting injured in that keg stand was the best thing that ever happened to him.

		there he is.

		whoa, whoa, whoa. He's going off book.

		So I booked a sketch artist, an improve troupe, and there'll be a laser projecting a burning pelvis onto the ceiling.

		I was voted most likely to succeed at my rehab clinic.

		Um, I don't know if I'm the right person for that.

		Tell me, dean, when I refer to you in my article, Would you prefer "imbecile" or "incompetent?"

		It doesn't matter what you want. The people want the truth. I have to give it to them. And I won't let anyone stand in my way. Excuse me.

		Thank you.

	jeff

		what board certifies a tutor?

		What about the "Look Left" speech?

		My Lord.

		I sang Christmas carols at a nursing home once. I've seen the face of dementia, and last night I saw it again.

		well, some of us are here to actually learn things.

		i may be naive, but i'm not stupid.

		We are studying, so Troy is busy

		i've been following you. how much did the dean pay you to make troy play football?

		because i'm right?

		and for that you'd convince troy to flush his life down football's toilet again? britta's right, you are the most selfish person alive! and all that is gonna end right now. because i'm telling him what kind of friend you really are.

		you're right. i could never be as good as you. probably because i actually care.

		hey. i've decided to support troy. they deploy things in football, right? i went for rhyme over clarity.

		really? because i'm an 18-year-old girl, and you made me cry in public.

		milord.

		Um, still waiting to hear back from Jeff and Pierce

		Are you coming to my Dias de los Muertos party?

		Then I can mark you down as definitely being there from 7:00 sharp till upside-down Spanish question mark?

		No, here's the thing. I am putting my foot down. You understand? I am being assertive, and I am making eye contact, and it is achieving results.

		It worked on Pierce.

		Jeff, you're the cool guy, okay?

		If you show up, it'll be the first party I host where everyone doesn't say they need to get home in time for the news.

		I was so unpopular in high school, the crossing guard used to lure me into traffic. This party is a second chance to be... Hip. Cool! Laidback!

		Thank you. I'm putting you down for two bags of ice and a sleeve of paper cups.

		my debate partner dropped out, And we need you to fill in for him at the championship tonight.

		topic for debate is "are people inherently good or evil?" So when do you want to get together to strategize?

		jeff, wait, when are we getting together To prepare for tomorrow?

		maybe simmons is right. You really are all sizzle and no steak. You probably couldn't beat him if you tried.

		really?

		abed is right. You act like things don't bother you, but they do.

		so, in the experiment, stanford students were divided Into prisoners and guards. The guards immediately started--

		what's wrong?

		it's called a stress headache. I got my first one when i was four.

		well, get used to it. You're knee-deep in it now, brother. This is debate. If you want to win, You need to prepare.

		oh, my gosh. You're right. Simmons is so good at using his inherent magnetism To sell his points, and here i am, Like a spinster librarian with my hair pulled back.

		What do you think?

		thanks.

		totally. We should get back to work.

		ooh, we can use this hobbes quote. "man is a collection "of base animal urges. "to act on them and experience "sinful pleasure would be morally no different Than taking a breath." That's poignant, right?

		yeah.

		uh-huh. That way we can be more reproductive--productive!

		Bye! oh, you forgot your phone.

		we make an amazing team.

		whoa, whoa, whoa. He's going off book.

		that off-book enough for ya?

		well, i'm going this way, so...

		thanks, pal. Just pat me.

		you have to get chang to call off some of this homework. You're the one with the silver tongue.

		well, guess what, handsome hobo. Your gravy train's leavin' the station.

		oh, now i feel bad that we made you do that. Maybe we can help with your essay.

		you devious clump Of overpriced fabric and hair product.

		oh, you're breaking up with the group?

		jeff, i'm sorry i called you a handsome hobo. If you need help with that essay, You can rejoin the group.

		Catch knowledge.

		The cafeteria's closed while we set up for the fair. Fortune cookie?

		Flip it over.

		I wrote that.

		See you later.

		Why didn't you do the extra-credit assignments if you knew that you were... failing?

		You expect me to watch you do that Without telling on you?

		No, they've got me editing the crossword Because I'm a girl. And because I love crosswords.

		Ace? You can do that?

		Jeff, I hope you've got an army of raisins Because I've got a major scoop. In October, There was a free toni braxton concert on the quad.

		And when a last-minute mix-up Shifted the show time by an hour, An anonymous text message went out Alerting students of the change.

		Not okay. Because the text message was sent exclusively To black students... And one french kid named lebron. That's profiling. This is front-page juice. Just gotta find out who sent the text.

		Well...Nobody's that stupid, right?

		Yeah, and this time he might succeed. If this article breaks out, I can apply for journalism scholarships. Nobody will care about my time in rehab If they think I'm a writer.

		This is greendale, jeff. We can do whatever we want.

		I guess we thought you would.

		Why not?

		Hey...

		I'm glad you did. It didn't even really occur to me what I was doing Until I saw how upset you were. And I never want to be the reason you're mad Because... You're jeff winger. So...Thanks... For getting mad.

		But if you like her, why would you want to keep her a secret? Don't you want us to meet her?

		Hey, guys, thanks for getting involved in my love life. That was super cool and mature of you. Oh, and since you're both clearly idiots, I should probably let you know that I'm being sarcastic.

		What?

		What? We haven't even kissed.

	abed

		How about you, abed? It's tomorrow.

		This is really important to me, abed. Could you please go as my friend? My really good friend?

		Oh, thank you, abed.

		Sorry you've been waiting 26 hours. It's just gonna be another five minutes.

		Go home!

		"Gotcha"? That's all you have to say?

		You sat in a room for 26 straight hours. Didn't that bother you?

		Then why didn't you leave?

		Abed, here. I wanted to say sorry for yelling at you.

		I just got the first three because... the fourth one blows.

		who's going to die?

		Oh, STD fair, guys. Catch knowledge.

		Abed, ew.

		What's going on?

	britta

		But maybe when Jeff gets here, we could talk to him as a group about his tardiness.

		Journalists are being murdered?

		Will you tell us more about Guatemala?

		But we need your help. We've been living on the wrong side of the looking glass. You're like Jodie Foster or Susan Sarandon. You'd rather keep it real than be likeable.

		That's horrible.

		Once it gets dark, I hand out the candles and we do  what's called "a speechless protest". We put the tape over our mouths, and gather hand-in-hand in a sea of outraged silence.

		What's gotten into you?

		We know it's not how you do it cause we're doing everything.

		Are you saying that we're not allowed to protest? Britta, you sound like Guatemala.

		You can hang the Chacata-Panecos pinata.

		Have you seen it?

		"The incident occurred during a protest regarding events in Guatemala." Awareness!

		where's shirley?

		why do we inflict so much pain on ourselves for men?

		i've been... infatuated with troy. now he's joining football. now he'll have his pick of the litter and... i'll never get to be with him!

		you're right. i can't control him. and if i truly cared about him, i wouldn't want to. thanks for talking to me, britta. it really helped.

		yes.

		Oh, Britta. You look adorable.

		Yeah.

		absolutely.

		britta, jeff suffered for us. give him a little credit.

		Catch knowledge.

		Guys... I have a problem. The dean wants me to demonstrate the proper use of a condom at the stupid fair by putting one on a mannequin's stupid... Thingamabob. It's a big honor... But I'm gonna screw it up.

		This is an anatomically correct model I'll be handling. Real... whatchamacallits... are nothing like bananas! Are they?

		Shh!

		I am not a unicorn. I had relations with my high school boyfriend. We did it to Madonna's erotica on the floor of his walk-in closet. But he wouldn't let me look at it. And he cried after. And during. He's gay now.

		I've caught glimpses, but I've never got a real good look at one. What I need to do is practice on the actual model, but the dean has it locked in his office.

		No! This is really embarrassing. I don't want anyone to know. I just want to figure out how to do it and get it over with. The dean is counting on me, and I want him to know that I'm someone he can trust. We have to break into his office.

		Shh.

		I'm the one that needs to see.

		Oh, boy. Oh, I had it wroooong! Is that considered large?

		Where did you go, britta?

		I'm not even wearing a bra.

		I haven't either.

		Yeah, I guess.

		Abed's really good at inviting people. We're all here to support you. Jeff even brought his girlfriend.

		Oh, he knows. They even had to file paperwork with the Dean. It's pretty serious. Our little Jeff's growing up!

		Oh! Break a leg, Britta. I have no idea how someone could do what you're about to do.

		Britta!

		Can I ask you something... About Vaughan?

		He's sweet, actually. I mean, you must have thought so.

		Would you... um, I haven't... we haven't... anything. I mean...

		Would it bug you?

		Troy... The other day after Spanish, I thought he was trying to hold my hand, but he'd just mistaken me for abed. He'll never think of me that way.

		Britta! Thank you. You're the coolest girl I've ever met.

		Cool.

		Hey, guys, thanks for getting involved in my love life. That was super cool and mature of you. Oh, and since you're both clearly idiots, I should probably let you know that I'm being sarcastic.

		You're not my mom, Britta. She would never wear boots that go up that High. And what about respecting me as an adult and as a friend?

		But you don't like Vaughan.

		I asked you if you cared, and you said no.

		What are you insinuating? I took that kiss for the team.

		Yeah.

		Okay. Vaughan wants to show me a cloud that looks like a Pumpkin... If that's okay.

	vaughan

		You're complicated.

		Spanish class.

		Vaughan, you remember Troy. Um, we went to High school together, and he's in my study group.

		No. I mean... I never want to lie to you, so I will tell you I did have feelings for him, but it's over, I swear.

		Vaughan.

		Did you get my messages?

	extra

		are you okay.

		Excuse me. Oh, sorry, ladies.

		Hola!

		Scary.

		Oh, cute! Cute.

	group

		i'd like to know why i had to find out About this group on accident?

		I guess Jeff's running late again.

		So who wants to be in a psych experiment?

		Please? You get paid.

		you're right! it's so unfair. And i can't handle this kind of stress right now.

		I'm already overwhelmed by my duties On the school song committee.

		i've already reported him to the dean. He said they've been trying to fire him for three years, But nobody wants his job.

		i vote we all look at jeff at the same time.

		oh...

		Where's Jeff?

		Guys, everyone's faith is weird. Let's just not talk about it.

		So whoever it is keeps hanging up, But he can't hide forever.

		Okay, so for the essay portion...

		Well, if we're gonna add a chair For every bong-ripping good-time charlie With a song in his heart, I move we institute hazing.

		We won't know the result.

		It would have been nice to have Another person in the group.

		Before we start, I'd like to have a preliminary powwow, or prelimi-wow, about what I'm calling our library's backdoor conundrum.

		The door on that side is locked after 5:00, which means that most of us have to walk all the way around. Now, if we were to move our meetings to 4:30...

		Well, maybe one of us could stand by the back door and let the rest in?

		Where is he?

		Why are we even talking about this?

		Vaughan told me he would take things as slowly as I wanted. He likes me for who I am, and I like him.

		I wouldn't hang out with you guys if you were creepy. Trust me. I have good taste.

	buddy

		Well, buddy, as you know, We haven't had spanish class yet. So this meeting was more just for catching up... Between friends.

		Excuse us...

	duncan

		Professor duncan! Professor duncan!

		Excuse me. Annie edison. I am in your 101 lecture.

		I've heard about your special psych lab.

		Yes. And i know it's limited to second-Year students, But i had a 4.0 at riverside high, And i'm not looking down on this school at all, But i'm only here because of a brief addiction to pills That i was told would help me...focus, But they actually made me lose my scholarship and virginity. So--

		If you would let me take your lab early, It would be a real feather in my transcript.

		Oh!

		Oh!

		Oh!

		Oh.

		No, that's just him.

		But you told me to bring subjects.

		Oh! Oh, that's so hilarious! Did you think of that The last time you skipped a trip to the dentist?

	self

		oh.

		News!

		It's like high school all over again. Everyone's leaving.

		yeah.

		Mm-mm.

		Noooooooo!

		Oh!

		Oh.

	babyjesus

		We know you were one of us.

	nurse

		Us? No. He's my very good friend. And I have appendicitis.

		Everywhere.

	humanbeing

		aah!

	brandi

		No! Before you two proceed, I have one thing to say...

		I want nana's blanket back. Do you guys mind? Could you scoot over? It's an heirloom. I want it back. Thank you. Have a nice date.

	simmons

		lay off, simmons. Jeff didn't understand the rules.

	shirley

		can we stop with the "pumpkins" and the "sweeties"? Being younger does not make me inferior. If anything, your age indicates That you've made bad life decisions.

		I forgive you.

		We could have a candlelight vigil like lesbians have on the news.

		Poignant.

		Did you guys know about  the ethnic cleansing in Burma?

		Shirley! That's the most racist thing i've ever heard.

		i'll go with you.

		shirley, will you please come to the bathroom with me?

		It's scary. If he's not interested, I could lose the friendship too.

		I'm going to roll them. I am. I just... I need a few more shakes.

		I don't care what you think. For me, that was huge.

		Guys... I have a problem. The dean wants me to demonstrate the proper use of a condom at the stupid fair by putting one on a mannequin's stupid... Thingamabob. It's a big honor... But I'm gonna screw it up.

		This is an anatomically correct model I'll be handling. Real... whatchamacallits... are nothing like bananas! Are they?

		I am not a unicorn. I had relations with my high school boyfriend. We did it to Madonna's erotica on the floor of his walk-in closet. But he wouldn't let me look at it. And he cried after. And during. He's gay now.

		I've caught glimpses, but I've never got a real good look at one. What I need to do is practice on the actual model, but the dean has it locked in his office.

		No! This is really embarrassing. I don't want anyone to know. I just want to figure out how to do it and get it over with. The dean is counting on me, and I want him to know that I'm someone he can trust. We have to break into his office.

		I'm the one that needs to see.

		Oh, boy. Oh, I had it wroooong! Is that considered large?

		"W-W-B-J-D"?

		I guess I could wear one of my Hanukah sweaters.

		Yep. One might even say I'm Jewish.

		I'd say the whole word next time.

		I think they're gonna come after Jeff's fight.

		Jeff wants to fight that bully.

		Shirley, you are a guilt machine.

		Yeah! That was really good.

		No more creepy than when Jeff wears tight jeans and you say, "I'd like to slap those buns on the grill."

	pierce

		"Annie".

		eew. no. i hired a local composer. But he's quite a handful.

		it is?

		pierce!

		i talked to the dean, And he said you can write greendale's school song.

		you know the statue dedication is this friday. So you have to have it done by then.

		if that's not enough time--

		great! There's a piano in the rehearsal space, And i'll help you out however i can. You're gonna do an awesome job!

		oh, good.

		that's exciting. Mind if i hear what you got so far?

		i'm just a little worried. I keep hearing the same two notes, And your sheet music Looks like a chinese takeout menu.

		what?

		I'm no more of a songwriter than you or billy joel. but what about the hawthorne wipes jingle?

		that's she'll be coming around the mountain.

		pierce, you're musical. you're creative. You can do this. i believe in you.

		you listen up, pierce! I'm gonna tell you what my mother told me When i wanted to quit cheerleading. You're not very pretty, you have no boobs, And you can't do a basket toss to save your life, But you made a commitment. So pick up your pompoms, pierce, Stuff your bra, and get ready for the team bus To forget you at a taco bell, because life is tough. But we soldier on, And that's just the way it goes. gonna play myself out.

		Um, still waiting to hear back from Jeff and Pierce

		Pierce? Pierce, are you okay?

		Pierce, relax. Just relax, okay? Pierce!

		Pierce...

		Tell me about the Beatles, Pierce. Tell me about Woodstock and Sputnik, Pierce.

		You mean the STD fair. Catch knowledge.

		Say the whole word!

		Oh, pierce, you became a grandfather?

		What?

	whitman

		i thought there might be a quiz.

		there he is.

	troy

		you're not prom king anymore, Troy. This isn't riverside high.

		because you're still wearing your stupid letter jacket. And more importantly, I sat behind you in Algebra.

		Yes, and you are a stupid jock who lost his scholarship by dislocating both shoulders in a keg stand.

		It's a serious disorder.

		me too. it sounds educational.

		No.

		No.

		Yay!

		Hi, troy.

		That was the experiment, troy. We were testing to see how long people would wait in the room.

		a small fading remnant of a star.

		that's right!

		what does a star turn into after it collapses?

		right! troy! you could be an astronomer.

		so we should still study a little more astronomy later, right? maybe over some milky ways or some mars bars.

		Ok, what's the closest planet to Earth?

		That's not the right answer, but it shows how fun the astronomy can be!

		troy, i've been waiting for an hour.

		troy. why are you doing a politically conservative high school shamefully outdated fight rap? have you been playing football?

		but you knew we had an astronomy test tomorrow.

		troy! stop! don't become this person again. this isn't the real you. this is the arrogant jock that totally ignored the only people that truly liked him for non-superficial reasons but weren't allowed to say anything because their parents are bigots! football is bad for you, troy.

		jeff...what now?

		Stop it, Troy.

		They could do something on campus. Tomorrow there's a picnic with live music on the East lawn. They're calling it "A night under the stars".

		Randi? I thought...

		You're welcome. And I hate you. And I want to have your children.

		Of course. Anytime. Ever.

		I'd love to.

		It's the blanket my grandmother used to court my grandfather.

		And you'll light the candles. And you'll take a bite. And she'll take a bite. And you'll laugh. And you'll offer her your letter jacket after you notice this funny way she shakes when she gets cold. And she'll feel like the luckiest girl in the world.

		Remember when you pretended to be my backpack?

		Troy, wait! I have to tell you... My appendix is bursting.

		My appendix is bursting.

		Thanks for bringing me here. Guess I ruined your date, huh?

		Okay, I need to go.

		No! Before you two proceed, I have one thing to say...

		I want nana's blanket back. Do you guys mind? Could you scoot over? It's an heirloom. I want it back. Thank you. Have a nice date.

		Oh, STD fair, guys. Catch knowledge.

		Oh, I don't know where abed is. I could try calling him if you want.

		Troy, you're being weird.

		What? Wait. Troy, what?

		I like him. Why would you do that?

		Wait, Jeff and Britta did what, now?

		What?

	chang

		Hi, senor chang.

		Well, we're just running a little bit behind, So we'll probably start in about five minutes.

		no!

		this monday?

		no.

		Yay! I meant about Jeff passing. You being our Spanish teacher, eh.



Speaker: basketballcoach

	all

		let's go, boys. come on, let's go. I want to see some hustlers out here. Let's go.

	whitman

		we reserved the gym For practice.

	extra

		oh, great try, bruce! great try.



Speaker: chang

	all

		Every once in a while, a student come up to me and ask, Why do you teach Spanish?" They say it just like that. "Why do you teach Spanish?" "Why you?" Why not math? Why not photography? Why not martial arts? I mean, surely it must be in my nature to instruct you in something that's ancient and secret like building a wall that you can see from outer space. Well, I'll tell you  why I teach Spanish. It is none of your business, okay? Now, I don't want to have any conversations about what a mysterious and inscrutable man I am. I am a Spanish genius! In espanol, my nickname is "El tigre chino"! 'Cause my knowledge will bite her face off! So don't question Senor Chang or you'll get bit. Ya bit. Ya bit! Friday Manana, we'll be having conversations with the rest of the class using some of the phrases we learned in unit one. You'll be partnering up in pairs of dos. If you look under your desk, you'll find a card with either a picture or a word on it. For ejemplo, blondie aqui has a card with a picture of a house on it. So that means the person with the card with the word casa on it, is her partner. Comprende, Star-burns? See you Friday. Find your partners. Have a great day. And what do we say at the end of every class? Come on, hands... 90 percent of Spanish.

		Hola, class. Time for our presentations. First up was supposed to be Jeff and Pierce, but Pierce explained the situation. Apparently there was a falling out, things were said, people were betrayed.

		Before we wrap up, i would like to thank you guys For filling out these anonymous evaluation cards. I found your feedback To be largely constructive and flattering, So gracias on that.

		No! No!

		silencio, por favor.

		All right, last night i graded your tests. I'm sure you wanna know how you did, right?

		well, i'm not gonna tell you. Until i find out who did...this!

		Containing all the information covered on the test. Otherwise known as a crib sheet. Who did it, huh?

		There's one asian stereotype that does apply to me. Whoever did this insulted my honor. And they've got 24 hours to come forward, Or mr. miyagi here will wax off everyone's score and the whole class gets a cero!

		so...this is the last chance For the cheater to be an adult and face la musica... Or everyone fails.

		you got ten seconds... Starting now.

		turn on her!

		Okay. time to learn some formal greetings.

		professor ben chang.

		with great pleasure. it was a tuesday, Uh, crack of dawn, 5:58 a.m. I got up, i took my morning deuce, I made a breakfast consisting of..

		and then she yelled, "screw you," Or, "screw education," or something like that, And then she stormed out of the room In her high-heel boots like it was tampon time... If you know what i mean.

		As you know, all faculty at greendale are required to give extra credit to students who organizes academic related events during what would otherwise be known as 'free time' No student in any department has ever exercised this option, until now.

		which is actually quite offensive to people familiar with mexican halloween as sexual position. At any rate, if you show up, you get extra credit. For me, I don't even get paid. See you tonight. In Espanol, Esta Noche

		So from now on, we'll refer to each other by our Spanish nombres. It will be...

		Class dismissed.

		pencils down.

		I want you all to write a one-page essay, in espanol, entitled, annie's mistake.

		okay, two pages, entitled, the consequences of questioning authority.

		oh, six pages on ignorance.

		20 pages on ass kissing! Due on monday.

		the difference between usted and tu Is a matter of formality.

		still formal, but plural. Because, while both are dirty, Neither are my friends. Okay? And, on another subject, Hope you guys are working hard on your essays. Because that's gonna be 30% of your grade.

		jeff...already turned in his essay.

		as soon as you turn in your essays on monday, There's gonna be a big-ass quiz. So study hard. class dismissed.

		i have something to say. I've been a horrible husband. And i've been a horrible teacher. And i'd like to thank my student jeff winger For showing me that And helping me fix my marriage. No more 20-page essays due on monday!

		Best exam ever. That guy's awesome, man.

		Who cheated?

		Feliz ano nueva, chicas!

		That was a professional actress. I am a man who can never die. And this has been your first taste Of spanish 1-0- dos-- The semester I get inside your cabesas!

	dean

		Wow, this may be the only STD fair to actually spread STDs.

		Oh, my God. That's why you don't print things on condoms. Everyone's getting preggers, and it's all your fault. Oh, God, I love it.

	troy

		y tupaco...

		ustedes estan sucios. "you are dirty."

		hola.

		Yeah. Clearly, none of my other plans fell through.

		That's pretty crazy.

		Shut up, man.

	jeff

		Jeff, having heard Pierce's side of the story, I think the only humane thing to do would be to give you a "C" and let Pierce do his presentation alone, if that sounds fair to you.

		Okay, guys? Why are there costumes involved? These are short conversations, they're not supposed to take...

		F.

		yeah, well, you got prince charles over here, Who's your drinking buddy.

		she confessed!

		Professor Slater? She's not grading papers. She's at the faculty party in the cafeteria.

		Are you saying my people are sneaky?

		Here. take this. Give anyone that shows up their stupid credit.

		Ah, give it up, Winger. Professor Slater doesn't date students. Or married Asians who drive Mopeds.

		I'll bring the hog around.

		Stop crying, Winger

		Gee, do I feel a breeze here? Because someone just struck out.

		Is that what you had to fall back on? Look at me, bro. Look at me. I've got the body of a fifth grader, okay? If I was working with what you've got, she'd be at the comfort inn right now giving me a Mexican Halloween.

		Moves? Everything's a game to guys like you. I know one move I bet you've never tried in your life.

		Loser!

		Buenos dias, Winger.

		what do you want, winger? Here to complain about the homework On behalf of the class?

		okay, freud. Sure. you try to penetrate my psychological armor, and--

		holy-- How did you know?

		we met at a salsa club.

		and, um... she loved the way i danced. But...i mean, you know how it goes. Just--get a job...

		you make no mistake about this, winger. I pleasured that woman greatly.

		i like you, winger. Pickled bull testicle?

		Great job.

		i'm sorry. This is so stupid.

		it's dumb!

		you better not be!

		all i ask Is for you to keep filling the void in my soul.

		hey! what's up? Just got your text, man. Wanna hang out? 'cause if you don't, i will fail you.
