Happy last day before winter break, Greendale! Time to visit our loved ones. Some of you will travel as far as three Miles! Don't forget to visit our winter wonderland in the quad, where we're giving away catalogues of next semester's classes. Whoa, what's that sound? Is that the tippy-tapping of secular boots on the roof? Oh, well, it must be yet another sign that it 'tis the season, because rumor has it that non-denominational Mr. Winter is on his way to the student lounge!	|Dean All	|01
Unh!	|Dean	|01
I'm so sick of the Dean jamming his PC down my throat.	|Shirley Group	|02
Pierce, I'd like to commend you for letting that one go.	|Jeff Pierce	|02
"PC-ness."	|Pierce	|02
Now I get it. It sounds like "penis". I just got it too.	|Troy Pierce	|02
Well, it's still Christmas to all of us, and I made you all a little gift, because you're like my new family.	|Shirley Group	|02
"W-W-B-J-D"?	|Annie Shirley	|02
If this stands for "What would Billy Joel do", I'll tell you right now... he'd write another crappy song.	|Pierce Troy	|02
Yeah, in your face, Billy Joel.	|Troy Pierce	|02
Who is that?	|Troy Group	|02
It stands for "What would baby Jesus do?" And it's to remind us that the real meaning of this season is Christmas.	|Shirley Group	|02
Oh, well, thank you, Shirley. I'm gonna put that in the pocket closest to my heart.	|Britta Shirley	|02
No, no, no, it's a bracelet. You put 'em on.	|Shirley Britta	|02
Everybody put 'em on.	|Shirley Group	|02
Hey. Hey! You took all the winter-doodles. What are you, a douche bag?	|Thug Abed	|03
They're for my friends. There's a lot of other cookies left.	|Abed Thug	|03
No, there's only macadamia nut cookies there, okay? I have a tree-nut allergy.	|Thug Abed	|03
You should probably stay away from Christmas-tree-shaped cookies.	|Abed Thug	|03
Ha ha! That did not even make allergic sense. What are you, an idiot?	|Thug Abed	|03
Okay, we get it. You and the A-team are awesome. Now beat it.	|Jeff Thug	|03
Oh, look at that. Pretty boy standing up for bird face over here. Give me a winter-doodle.	|Thug Jeff	|03
If you're trying to be menacing, maybe don't call the cookie by its name.	|Jeff Thug	|03
Oh, you're funny. You're a funny man. Want to hear something funny, funny man? Knock, knock. My fist up your balls!	|Thug Jeff	|03
Who's there?	|Jeff Thug	|03
Ha ha ha! Merry happy!	|Dean All	|03
This ain't over. There won't always be a Dean around. All right?	|Thug Jeff	|03
Still waiting on those cookies, Abed.	|Pierce Abed	|04
Jeff protected my honor. It was like my bodyguard, but I was the kid from meatballs, Jeff was the guy from full metal jacket, and the moustache guy was the brother of the guy on entourage.	|Abed Group	|04
Thanks for dumbing that down for us.	|Jeff Abed	|04
You got it.	|Abed Jeff	|04
So what's the deal, Jeff? You leave your stones in your other suit? Why didn't you rap that guy in the face?	|Pierce Jeff	|04
For the same reason that I floss, have a bed frame, and keep my guitar in its case... I'm over 23.	|Jeff Pierce	|04
I'm proud of you for handling it peacefully, Jeff, like a certain little birthday boy. Real men turn the other cheek.	|Shirley Jeff	|04
Let's see 'em.	|Shirley Group	|04
Nonsense. Men were wired to fight each other so that women could choose the right mate.	|Pierce Group	|04
No, the real reason men fight is to release their pent-up gayness.	|Britta Pierce	|04
That guy wasn't gay. He had a moustache.	|Pierce Britta	|04
You know what I have? Finals. Are we cramming for Spanish or not? I need a 65, or I'm gonna flunk the class.	|Jeff Group	|04
Why didn't you do the extra-credit assignments if you knew that you were... failing?	|Annie Jeff	|04
Because doing more than the minimum work is my definition of... failing.	|Jeff Abed	|04
Quick question... Are you all coming to my Christmas party right after the final, or are you stopping home to change into your Christmas outfits?	|Shirley Group	|04
I guess I could wear one of my Hanukah sweaters.	|Annie Shirley	|04
Uh, Annie... I... I didn't know you weren't, um, Christian.	|Shirley Annie	|04
Yep. One might even say I'm Jewish.	|Annie Shirley	|04
Oh, t... that's good for you. T... that's wonderful. I respect all religions of the world.	|Shirley Annie	|04
I'm Muslim.	|Abed Group	|04
Jehovah's witness.	|Troy Group	|04
Atheist.	|Britta Group	|04
The Lord is testing me.	|Shirley	|04
Guys, this is a subject that breeds conflicts. Can we please do...	|Jeff Group	|04
What religion are you, Jeff?	|Abed Jeff	|04
I'm agnostic.	|Jeff Group	|04
Agnostic... lazy man's atheist.	|Pierce Jeff	|04
I'm born-again.	|Pierce Group	|04
Oh.	|Shirley Pierce	|04
Yeah, we had a re-birthing ritual in my friend's hot tub. I'm now a level-five laser lotus in my Buddhist community.	|Pierce Group	|04
Uh, that does not sound like Buddhism. Are you sure you're not in a cult?	|Britta Pierce	|04
Just by asking me that question, you've put me back down to a level four. You now owe me 2,000 Energon cubes.	|Pierce Britta	|04
Do you know how foolish you sound right now? What else do you believe in, blood transfusions?	|Troy Pierce	|04
Jehovah's witnesses are a type of Christian, right, Troy?	|Shirley Pierce	|04
Yeah, but we don't celebrate birthdays or Christmas, and we can't drink. But it helps.	|Troy Group	|04
So you're like a Muslim. Salaam alaikum.	|Abed Troy	|04
Shama-lama-ding-dong.	|Troy Abed	|04
Wow, don't we have a diverse little family. I say we open up this... this party to all faiths. I brought my star of Bethlehem, which led the wise men to the savior of all mankind. And you guys can bring a little trinket or doodad from your philosophies. Sounds good?	|Shirley Group	|04
As an agnostic, I'm gonna bring my winning smile.	|Jeff Group	|04
That's not enough.	|Jeff	|04
Ugh! So boring.	|Chang	|05
Done. Hee hee. Hee hee. Hmm. Feliz Navidad.	|Shirley All	|05
"True or falso or none of the above?" That doesn't make any sense.	|Jeff Chang	|05
Hey, look at that. Forehead's taking a test.	|Thug Jeff	|06
Why don't you get going, Chuck Norris?	|Jeff Thug	|06
Did you just shoo me?	|Thug Jeff	|06
Why don't you just kiss him already?	|Britta Jeff Thug	|06
Dude, I will shoo your nose down your throat!	|Thug Jeff	|06
Senor Chang, can you do something about this?	|Jeff Chang	|06
I'll allow it.	|Chang Jeff	|06
Que pasa here, huh? It's usted, dude. Even I know that.	|Thug Jeff	|06
You picked the wrong day to correct my Spanish, no sleeves. It's on!	|Jeff Thug	|06
He's doing this for me. He's my bodyguard.	|Abed Thug	|06
You wanna dance?	|Thug Jeff	|06
Maybe to some show tunes?	|Britta Thug Jeff	|06
No, I want to beat the crap out of you. And I'm gonna enjoy it, because you're just like this school. You're obnoxious, you're cramping my style, and you smell like French-fry oil.	|Jeff Thug	|06
I don't get it!	|Thug Jeff	|06
Three O'clock, bike rack, But not the one by the parking lot!	|Jeff Thug	|06
Right! The one by the trash cans near the orange cones where they're building the wheelchair ramp!	|Thug Jeff	|06
Yeah.	|Jeff Thug	|06
Best exam ever. That guy's awesome, man.	|Chang All	|06
So help me if that jerk-weed made me fail.	|Jeff Pierce	|07
Well, I aced it, amigo. That means "cousin".	|Pierce Jeff	|07
So what's my role going to be in the fight? Is there a key moment where I finally stand up for myself and take revenge on the villain?	|Abed Jeff	|07
Uh, maybe you should just hang back.	|Jeff Abed	|07
Yeah I will. In his face!	|Abed Jeff	|07
Whatever you do, don't tell Shirley about the fight. She'll start in with all her mother-y, guilt-inducing powers. You know what I mean?	|Jeff Abed Troy Pierce	|07
No. I'm wearing this Jesus bracelet 'cause it gets me chicks.	|Troy Jeff	|07
I know guys like this Mike. He used to be a nerd. Now he's a meathead. Dangerous combo. Tyson, Lou Ferrigno, Rosie O'Donnell.	|Pierce Jeff	|07
You're a pretty big dude. Probably got some moves.	|Troy Jeff	|07
Yeah, I got some... theories.	|Jeff Troy	|07
You've never been in a fight?	|Abed Jeff	|07
Technically, no. I guess I'm too charming and likable. Call me a name.	|Jeff Abed Troy	|07
I can't.	|Troy Jeff	|07
Are you telling me you've never been punched in the face?	|Pierce Jeff	|07
No, thank God. This is the moneymaker.	|Jeff Pierce	|07
First time I got punched in the face, I was like, "Oh, no!" But then I was like, "This is a story".	|Troy Jeff	|07
And a good one.	|Jeff Troy	|07
Yeah.	|Troy Jeff	|07
Every man should be punched in the face. It's a rite of passage. In my day, Friday night was smoke a doobie, feel up a gal, and then get your teeth knocked out by a republican.	|Pierce Jeff	|07
Guys the plan here isn't for me to get hit. It's for me to hit him.	|Jeff Pierce	|07
Oh, then it's settled. We have to teach Jeffrey how to fight. I know a few moves.	|Pierce Troy Abed	|07
Troy, I assume you're handy with a switchblade.	|Pierce Troy	|07
Abed, you get back to the family tent, try to find a chicken for Jeff to Chase.	|Pierce Abed	|07
Guys, I appreciate the enthusiasm, but, uh, I think I got this.	|Jeff Troy Abed Pierce	|07
Oh, well, look who it is. We got forehead, old head, dumb head, and, uh... the other head. See you at 3:00, forehead.	|Thug Jeff	|08
Give me a snowman, dork!	|Thug Extra	|08
See this, funny guy? Huh? Huh?	|Thug Jeff	|08
Classic Rosie.	|Pierce All	|09
Fight lessons in a half an hour?	|Troy Jeff	|09
Good plan.	|Jeff Troy	|09
Hello. Oh. Is this your Hanukkah holder? It's, uh... it's pretty. We'll just, uh... Let's just put it... There we go. That's nice. So I can't believe I never knew you were a Jew.	|Shirley Annie	|10
I'd say the whole word next time.	|Annie Shirley	|10
So, uh, do you think everyone will start arriving soon?	|Shirley Annie	|10
I think they're gonna come after Jeff's fight.	|Annie Shirley	|10
After Jeff's what now?	|Shirley Annie	|10
Jeff wants to fight that bully.	|Annie Shirley	|10
On Christmas? Um, will you excuse me for a moment? And can you finish the manger scene?	|Shirley Annie	|10
We know you were one of us.	|Annie BabyJesus	|10
'Sup? 'Sup?	|Troy Jeff	|11
'Sup!	|Jeff Troy	|11
No, it's a question. 'Sup?	|Troy Jeff	|11
'Sup?	|Jeff Troy	|11
Not a real question, a rhetorical one. You have the answer. He does not. Okay, then you give him the forest Whitaker eye.	|Troy Jeff	|11
That's pretty good.	|Jeff Troy	|11
Mm-hmm. Okay, hold that stare. There you go. Hold it. Then you look straight through his eyes and deep into his soul.	|Troy Jeff	|11
And then you move to Vermont.	|Britta Jeff Troy	|11
I am sick and tired of you saying that fighting is gay!	|Troy Britta	|11
She's got a point. You know, in boxing, you fight for the purse and the belt.	|Abed Troy Britta	|11
I've gotta write a paper about that.	|Britta Abed	|11
All right, I've seen enough. Let's see what we're working with. Go ahead, throw a few at the old paws. What are you, a North Korean seamstress?	|Pierce Jeff	|11
Not if that's bad.	|Jeff Pierce	|11
Get mad! Come on! If it helps, think of me as somebody who annoys you. Ooh, that's it! That's... that's good.	|Pierce Jeff	|11
Britta, put your blouse back on.	|Pierce Britta	|11
Oh! Ow!	|Jeff	|11
Boys, this is not a game. You gotta be ready for anything.	|Pierce Jeff	|11
Dude, that is not cool!	|Troy Pierce	|11
Well, that foxy Black girl thinks it is.	|Pierce Troy	|11
Hmm? Ow!	|Troy	|11
What are you doing?	|Jeff Pierce	|11
Why does she have to be black?	|Troy Pierce	|11
What is going on?	|Shirley Group	|12
We're trying to get Jeff ready for the fiiiii...iiight.	|Troy Shirley	|12
I couldn't think of another word.	|Troy Jeff	|12
Idiot.	|Jeff Troy	|12
He meant we were figh... ...ting.	|Jeff Shirley	|12
It is hard to think of another word.	|Jeff Troy	|12
You realize there's no other way for me to take this than as a giant middle finger to the most important day of the year.	|Shirley Jeff	|12
December 10th?	|Jeff Shirley	|12
It's our Christmas, and I'm having a party. Due to my divorce and my relatives picking sides, this will be the only Christmas party I throw this year. Will you be there, or will I have another family letting me down?	|Shirley Group	|12
I told him not to fight. He wouldn't listen. I don't know what that is.	|Pierce Shirley	|12
Jeffrey, I have two boys. And when we have a serious discussion, I find that a brownie helps them to relax. So why do you hate me and Jesus?	|Shirley Jeff	|12
I don't think my brownie's working.	|Jeff Shirley	|12
Please don't do something so ugly on a day so important to me.	|Shirley Jeff	|12
Again, it's December 10th.	|Jeff Shirley	|12
You think religion is stupid?	|Shirley Jeff	|12
No, no. To me, religion is like Paul Rudd. I see the appeal, and I would never take it away from anyone. But I would also never stand in line for it. And look, Shirley, the die has been cast with this crazy bully guy. He picked on Abed, and he corrected my Spanish. So you go to your party, and I'll see you soon.	|Jeff Shirley	|12
Jeffrey, I forbid you from fighting.	|Shirley Jeff	|12
Well, you don't get to. You're not my mom.	|Jeff Shirley	|12
You're right. But if you show up for the fight, don't show up for my party.	|Shirley Jeff	|12
Oh, come on, Shirley, don't be mad.	|Jeff Shirley	|12
I'm not mad. I'm disappointed.	|Shirley Jeff	|12
That's "mom" for mad.	|Jeff Shirley	|12
Oh, hash browns and applesauce... That's nice.	|Shirley Annie	|13
Oh, what is that interesting smell?	|Shirley Abed	|13
It's a traditional Muslim dish.	|Abed Shirley	|13
It looks delicious. I'm guessing as a woman I won't be allowed to eat that. That's too bad.	|Shirley Abed	|13
Oh, look, Britta brought what she believes in... nothing.	|Shirley Britta	|13
Where should I put my Buddha incense holder?	|Pierce Britta	|13
I'm pretty sure that's a bong.	|Britta Pierce	|13
Where's Jeff?	|Annie Group	|14
I guess he made his choice.	|Shirley Group	|14
I want to go to Jeff's fight.	|Troy Group	|14
As I told Jeff, no one that goes to the fight can come to my party. He's dead to me. And if any of you leave, you'll be dead to me too. Let's sing. # Jesus is a friend of mine # everybody! # Jesus is a friend of mine # Come on, everybody. You don't know it?	|Shirley Group	|14
You're banning Jeff from the party? That doesn't seem very Christian.	|Britta Shirley	|14
Well, that's an interesting point of view coming from an atheist.	|Shirley Britta	|14
I did my best to create a special Christmas for my one intact family, and... this is the thanks I get.	|Shirley Group	|14
Shirley, you are a guilt machine.	|Annie Shirley	|14
And Annie knows a thing or two about guilt. Am I right, Jew?	|Pierce Annie	|14
Say the whole word!	|Annie Pierce	|14
Jewie?	|Pierce Annie	|14
You would never catch a Jehovah's witness saying "Jewie".	|Troy Pierce	|14
Tell it to the birthday cake you never got.	|Pierce	|14
You know, there's an old Buddhist saying in my vision group...	|Pierce Troy	|14
You are not a Buddhist. You are in a cult.	|Britta Pierce	|14
Suck it, Nietzsche!	|Pierce Britta	|14
Guys, everyone's faith is weird. Let's just not talk about it.	|Annie Group	|14
There's nothing weird about Christianity.	|Shirley Group	|14
Guys! Guys! Guys! Guys! Are we really gonna let religion divide us like this? I think there's one thing we can all agree on.	|Britta Group	|14
I get 72 virgins in heaven.	|Abed Britta	|14
No.	|Britta Abed	|14
That we would all like to have Jeff at this party.	|Britta Group	|14
Mm-mm.	|Annie	|14
He can't come.	|Shirley Britta	|14
Shirley.	|Britta Shirley	|14
Mm-mm.	|Shirley	|14
Shirley, listen. I get that this is your first Christmas since your husband left you, and I don't know, maybe that's why you're being so stubborn, because you're trying so hard to re-create something that you're afraid that you've lost forever. But if you really want us to be your second family, then you've gotta start treating us like one, even if that means supporting us when we do things that you don't agree with. You can start by rooting for Jeff while he rolls around on the ground groping another man. That's what I'm gonna do.	|Britta Shirley	|14
The cranberry sauce has real cranberries.	|Shirley Group	|14
Look, if he doesn't show up, We're definitely going to Applebee's, right?	|Thug Extra	|15
Yeah.	|Extra Thug	|15
I'm getting into a fight no matter what today, dude. No matter what! Look who showed. Oh, check him out. Ahh...ahh!	|Thug Extra	|15
What's up, dude? No backup today? Huh? Looks like grandpa and weirdo couldn't show up to get their teeth knocked out, huh?	|Thug Jeff	|16
Can I ask you a question? Are you perpetually on your way to the gym?	|Jeff Thug	|16
Dude, my life is a gym!	|Thug Jeff	|16
Well, 'sup?	|Jeff Thug	|16
'Sup, man?	|Thug Jeff	|16
'Sup?	|Jeff Thug	|16
'Sup?	|Thug Jeff	|16
'Sup? 'Sup?	|Jeff Thug	|16
'Sup? 'Sup?	|Thug Jeff	|16
'Sup? 'Sup?	|Jeff Thug	|16
'Sup? 'Sup?	|Thug Jeff	|16
'Sup? 'Sup?	|Jeff Thug	|16
Whoa. Dude, what is that?	|Thug Jeff	|16
All right, just one sec. These are very expensive. All right...	|Jeff Thug	|16
Dude, you wear a bracelet?	|Thug Jeff	|16
Your name's Mike, right?	|Jeff Thug	|16
So?	|Thyg Jeff	|16
Mike, I'm not gonna fight you. I have a friend that believes this is the time of year where you put aside your differences, and you make peace. Me... I don't believe in any of that, but I do believe in friendship. And as much as I hate you and the cast of breakin', I have to ask myself, what would Shirley do?	|Jeff Thug	|16
Oh!	|Shirley	|16
What would Shirley do?	|Thug Jeff	|16
I think...	|Jeff Thug	|16
What would Shirley do?	|Thug Jeff	|16
That she would shake your hand and wish you a Merry Christmas.	|Jeff Thug	|16
Jeffrey... Kick his ass!	|Shirley Jeff	|16
Cavalry's here. Shirts off, boys!	|Thug Extra	|16
Come on, I'm being punked, right?	|Britta All	|16
Come here. Come here.	|Thug Extra	|16
Please, it's Christmas.	|Extra Shirley	|17
It's December 10th!	|Shirley Extra	|17
Not the moneymaker. Not the moneymaker!	|Jeff Thug	|17
You're welcome!	|Pierce Jeff	|17
Yeah! That was really good.	|Annie Shirley	|18
Yeah!	|Jeff Shirley	|18
That was nice.	|Britta Shirley	|18
Thank you, thank you. I get it, yes. It is I, Senior Chang.	|Chang Group	|19
Shakira, hold this.	|Chang Shirley	|19
So... I have finished grading everyone's finals, and all of you are moving on. Heh heh heh, except... for Jeff.	|Chang Group	|19
Turns out you... pause for dramatic effect... will be seeing me next semester.	|Chang Jeff	|19
Noooooooo!	|Annie	|19
In Spanish 102! Heh heh heh. Because he passed, you know. And I'm the only Spanish teacher.	|Chang Group	|19
Yay! I meant about Jeff passing. You being our Spanish teacher, eh.	|Annie Chang	|19
Whoa. Man, Mike got you good.	|Chang Jeff	|19
Actually, uh, that was my present to Jeff.	|Pierce Chang	|19
I don't care. I got a Mountain to shred.	|Chang Pierce	|19
Jeffrey, you're a man now. How's it feel?	|Pierce Jeff	|19
I got hit in the face, like, four times before you punched me.	|Jeff Pierce	|19
Some people just don't know how to say thank you.	|Pierce Jeff	|19
Pierce, thank you.	|Jeff Pierce	|19
And thanks to all of you for showing up and having my back when we fought those fly dancers. So, uh... Merry...	|Jeff Group	|19
No, no, no, no, no. Holiday.	|Shirley Group	|19
Actually, I was gonna say merry semester and happy new one.	|Jeff Shirley	|19
Oh Christmas Troy, oh Christmas Troy, thy candles shine so brightly. Oh Christmas Troy, oh Christmas Troy, much pleasure thou canst give me.	|Abed Troy	|20
Why do you guys do stuff like this?	|Jeff Troy Abed	|20
'cause it's fun?	|Troy Jeff	|20
Don't move	|Abed Troy	|20
This nose smells like the special drink	|Troy Abed	|20

		And a good one.

		Guys, I appreciate the enthusiasm, but, uh, I think I got this.

		Good plan.

		'Sup!

		'Sup?

		That's pretty good.

		Idiot.

		It is hard to think of another word.

		Why do you guys do stuff like this?

	abed

		Thanks for dumbing that down for us.

		Because doing more than the minimum work is my definition of... failing.

		Uh, maybe you should just hang back.

		Whatever you do, don't tell Shirley about the fight. She'll start in with all her mother-y, guilt-inducing powers. You know what I mean?

		Technically, no. I guess I'm too charming and likable. Call me a name.

		Guys, I appreciate the enthusiasm, but, uh, I think I got this.

		Why do you guys do stuff like this?

	thug

		Okay, we get it. You and the A-team are awesome. Now beat it.

		If you're trying to be menacing, maybe don't call the cookie by its name.

		Who's there?

		Why don't you get going, Chuck Norris?

		You picked the wrong day to correct my Spanish, no sleeves. It's on!

		No, I want to beat the crap out of you. And I'm gonna enjoy it, because you're just like this school. You're obnoxious, you're cramping my style, and you smell like French-fry oil.

		Three O'clock, bike rack, But not the one by the parking lot!

		Yeah.

		Can I ask you a question? Are you perpetually on your way to the gym?

		Well, 'sup?

		'Sup?

		'Sup? 'Sup?

		'Sup? 'Sup?

		'Sup? 'Sup?

		All right, just one sec. These are very expensive. All right...

		Your name's Mike, right?

		Mike, I'm not gonna fight you. I have a friend that believes this is the time of year where you put aside your differences, and you make peace. Me... I don't believe in any of that, but I do believe in friendship. And as much as I hate you and the cast of breakin', I have to ask myself, what would Shirley do?

		I think...

		That she would shake your hand and wish you a Merry Christmas.

		Not the moneymaker. Not the moneymaker!

	shirley

		He meant we were figh... ...ting.

		December 10th?

		I don't think my brownie's working.

		Again, it's December 10th.

		No, no. To me, religion is like Paul Rudd. I see the appeal, and I would never take it away from anyone. But I would also never stand in line for it. And look, Shirley, the die has been cast with this crazy bully guy. He picked on Abed, and he corrected my Spanish. So you go to your party, and I'll see you soon.

		Well, you don't get to. You're not my mom.

		Oh, come on, Shirley, don't be mad.

		That's "mom" for mad.

		Yeah!

		Actually, I was gonna say merry semester and happy new one.

	chang

		"True or falso or none of the above?" That doesn't make any sense.

		Senor Chang, can you do something about this?



Speaker: extra

	thug

		Yeah.

	shirley

		Please, it's Christmas.



Speaker: thyg

	jeff

		So?



Speaker: abed

	group

		Jeff protected my honor. It was like my bodyguard, but I was the kid from meatballs, Jeff was the guy from full metal jacket, and the moustache guy was the brother of the guy on entourage.

		I'm Muslim.

	jeff

		You got it.

		What religion are you, Jeff?

		So what's my role going to be in the fight? Is there a key moment where I finally stand up for myself and take revenge on the villain?

		Yeah I will. In his face!

		You've never been in a fight?

	britta

		She's got a point. You know, in boxing, you fight for the purse and the belt.

		I get 72 virgins in heaven.

	troy

		So you're like a Muslim. Salaam alaikum.

		She's got a point. You know, in boxing, you fight for the purse and the belt.

		Oh Christmas Troy, oh Christmas Troy, thy candles shine so brightly. Oh Christmas Troy, oh Christmas Troy, much pleasure thou canst give me.

		Don't move

	thug

		They're for my friends. There's a lot of other cookies left.

		You should probably stay away from Christmas-tree-shaped cookies.

		He's doing this for me. He's my bodyguard.

	shirley

		It's a traditional Muslim dish.



Speaker: thug

	abed

		Hey. Hey! You took all the winter-doodles. What are you, a douche bag?

		No, there's only macadamia nut cookies there, okay? I have a tree-nut allergy.

		Ha ha! That did not even make allergic sense. What are you, an idiot?

	extra

		Give me a snowman, dork!

		Look, if he doesn't show up, We're definitely going to Applebee's, right?

		I'm getting into a fight no matter what today, dude. No matter what! Look who showed. Oh, check him out. Ahh...ahh!

		Cavalry's here. Shirts off, boys!

		Come here. Come here.

	jeff

		Oh, look at that. Pretty boy standing up for bird face over here. Give me a winter-doodle.

		Oh, you're funny. You're a funny man. Want to hear something funny, funny man? Knock, knock. My fist up your balls!

		This ain't over. There won't always be a Dean around. All right?

		Hey, look at that. Forehead's taking a test.

		Did you just shoo me?

		Dude, I will shoo your nose down your throat!

		Que pasa here, huh? It's usted, dude. Even I know that.

		You wanna dance?

		I don't get it!

		Right! The one by the trash cans near the orange cones where they're building the wheelchair ramp!

		Oh, well, look who it is. We got forehead, old head, dumb head, and, uh... the other head. See you at 3:00, forehead.

		See this, funny guy? Huh? Huh?

		What's up, dude? No backup today? Huh? Looks like grandpa and weirdo couldn't show up to get their teeth knocked out, huh?

		Dude, my life is a gym!

		'Sup, man?

		'Sup?

		'Sup? 'Sup?

		'Sup? 'Sup?

		Whoa. Dude, what is that?

		Dude, you wear a bracelet?

		What would Shirley do?

		What would Shirley do?



Speaker: troy

	pierce

		Now I get it. It sounds like "penis". I just got it too.

		Yeah, in your face, Billy Joel.

		Do you know how foolish you sound right now? What else do you believe in, blood transfusions?

		Dude, that is not cool!

		Why does she have to be black?

		You would never catch a Jehovah's witness saying "Jewie".

	group

		Who is that?

		Jehovah's witness.

		Yeah, but we don't celebrate birthdays or Christmas, and we can't drink. But it helps.

		I want to go to Jeff's fight.

	jeff

		No. I'm wearing this Jesus bracelet 'cause it gets me chicks.

		You're a pretty big dude. Probably got some moves.

		I can't.

		First time I got punched in the face, I was like, "Oh, no!" But then I was like, "This is a story".

		Yeah.

		Fight lessons in a half an hour?

		'Sup? 'Sup?

		No, it's a question. 'Sup?

		Not a real question, a rhetorical one. You have the answer. He does not. Okay, then you give him the forest Whitaker eye.

		Mm-hmm. Okay, hold that stare. There you go. Hold it. Then you look straight through his eyes and deep into his soul.

		I couldn't think of another word.

		'cause it's fun?

	self

		Hmm? Ow!

	abed

		Shama-lama-ding-dong.

		This nose smells like the special drink

	britta

		I am sick and tired of you saying that fighting is gay!

	shirley

		We're trying to get Jeff ready for the fiiiii...iiight.



Speaker: annie

	pierce

		Say the whole word!

	group

		Where's Jeff?

		Guys, everyone's faith is weird. Let's just not talk about it.

	babyjesus

		We know you were one of us.

	self

		Mm-mm.

		Noooooooo!

	jeff

		Why didn't you do the extra-credit assignments if you knew that you were... failing?

	shirley

		"W-W-B-J-D"?

		I guess I could wear one of my Hanukah sweaters.

		Yep. One might even say I'm Jewish.

		I'd say the whole word next time.

		I think they're gonna come after Jeff's fight.

		Jeff wants to fight that bully.

		Shirley, you are a guilt machine.

		Yeah! That was really good.

	chang

		Yay! I meant about Jeff passing. You being our Spanish teacher, eh.



Speaker: britta

	pierce

		No, the real reason men fight is to release their pent-up gayness.

		Uh, that does not sound like Buddhism. Are you sure you're not in a cult?

		I'm pretty sure that's a bong.

		You are not a Buddhist. You are in a cult.

	group

		Atheist.

		Guys! Guys! Guys! Guys! Are we really gonna let religion divide us like this? I think there's one thing we can all agree on.

		That we would all like to have Jeff at this party.

	jeff

		Why don't you just kiss him already?

		Maybe to some show tunes?

		And then you move to Vermont.

	abed

		I've gotta write a paper about that.

		No.

	troy

		And then you move to Vermont.

	all

		Come on, I'm being punked, right?

	thug

		Why don't you just kiss him already?

		Maybe to some show tunes?

	shirley

		Oh, well, thank you, Shirley. I'm gonna put that in the pocket closest to my heart.

		You're banning Jeff from the party? That doesn't seem very Christian.

		Shirley.

		Shirley, listen. I get that this is your first Christmas since your husband left you, and I don't know, maybe that's why you're being so stubborn, because you're trying so hard to re-create something that you're afraid that you've lost forever. But if you really want us to be your second family, then you've gotta start treating us like one, even if that means supporting us when we do things that you don't agree with. You can start by rooting for Jeff while he rolls around on the ground groping another man. That's what I'm gonna do.

		That was nice.



Speaker: shirley

	pierce

		Oh.

		Jehovah's witnesses are a type of Christian, right, Troy?

	group

		I'm so sick of the Dean jamming his PC down my throat.

		Well, it's still Christmas to all of us, and I made you all a little gift, because you're like my new family.

		It stands for "What would baby Jesus do?" And it's to remind us that the real meaning of this season is Christmas.

		Everybody put 'em on.

		Let's see 'em.

		Quick question... Are you all coming to my Christmas party right after the final, or are you stopping home to change into your Christmas outfits?

		Wow, don't we have a diverse little family. I say we open up this... this party to all faiths. I brought my star of Bethlehem, which led the wise men to the savior of all mankind. And you guys can bring a little trinket or doodad from your philosophies. Sounds good?

		What is going on?

		It's our Christmas, and I'm having a party. Due to my divorce and my relatives picking sides, this will be the only Christmas party I throw this year. Will you be there, or will I have another family letting me down?

		I guess he made his choice.

		As I told Jeff, no one that goes to the fight can come to my party. He's dead to me. And if any of you leave, you'll be dead to me too. Let's sing. # Jesus is a friend of mine # everybody! # Jesus is a friend of mine # Come on, everybody. You don't know it?

		I did my best to create a special Christmas for my one intact family, and... this is the thanks I get.

		There's nothing weird about Christianity.

		The cranberry sauce has real cranberries.

		No, no, no, no, no. Holiday.

	jeff

		I'm proud of you for handling it peacefully, Jeff, like a certain little birthday boy. Real men turn the other cheek.

		You realize there's no other way for me to take this than as a giant middle finger to the most important day of the year.

		Jeffrey, I have two boys. And when we have a serious discussion, I find that a brownie helps them to relax. So why do you hate me and Jesus?

		Please don't do something so ugly on a day so important to me.

		You think religion is stupid?

		Jeffrey, I forbid you from fighting.

		You're right. But if you show up for the fight, don't show up for my party.

		I'm not mad. I'm disappointed.

		Jeffrey... Kick his ass!

	self

		The Lord is testing me.

		Mm-mm.

		Oh!

	extra

		It's December 10th!

	all

		Done. Hee hee. Hee hee. Hmm. Feliz Navidad.

	abed

		Oh, what is that interesting smell?

		It looks delicious. I'm guessing as a woman I won't be allowed to eat that. That's too bad.

	annie

		Uh, Annie... I... I didn't know you weren't, um, Christian.

		Oh, t... that's good for you. T... that's wonderful. I respect all religions of the world.

		Hello. Oh. Is this your Hanukkah holder? It's, uh... it's pretty. We'll just, uh... Let's just put it... There we go. That's nice. So I can't believe I never knew you were a Jew.

		So, uh, do you think everyone will start arriving soon?

		After Jeff's what now?

		On Christmas? Um, will you excuse me for a moment? And can you finish the manger scene?

		Oh, hash browns and applesauce... That's nice.

	britta

		No, no, no, it's a bracelet. You put 'em on.

		Oh, look, Britta brought what she believes in... nothing.

		Well, that's an interesting point of view coming from an atheist.

		He can't come.



Speaker: chang

	pierce

		I don't care. I got a Mountain to shred.

	group

		Thank you, thank you. I get it, yes. It is I, Senior Chang.

		So... I have finished grading everyone's finals, and all of you are moving on. Heh heh heh, except... for Jeff.

		In Spanish 102! Heh heh heh. Because he passed, you know. And I'm the only Spanish teacher.

	jeff

		I'll allow it.

		Turns out you... pause for dramatic effect... will be seeing me next semester.

		Whoa. Man, Mike got you good.

	self

		Ugh! So boring.

	all

		Best exam ever. That guy's awesome, man.

	shirley

		Shakira, hold this.



	Speaker: dean	Listeners: all
Happy last day before winter break, Greendale! Time to visit our loved ones. Some of you will travel as far as three Miles! Don't forget to visit our winter wonderland in the quad, where we're giving away catalogues of next semester's classes. Whoa, what's that sound? Is that the tippy-tapping of secular boots on the roof? Oh, well, it must be yet another sign that it 'tis the season, because rumor has it that non-denominational Mr. Winter is on his way to the student lounge!
	Speaker: dean	Listeners: self
Unh!

	Speaker: annie	Listeners: shirley
"W-W-B-J-D"?

If this stands for "What would Billy Joel do", I'll tell you right now... he'd write another crappy song.

Yeah, in your face, Billy Joel.
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: group
Who is that?

For the same reason that I floss, have a bed frame, and keep my guitar in its case... I'm over 23.

I'm proud of you for handling it peacefully, Jeff, like a certain little birthday boy. Real men turn the other cheek.
	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: group
Let's see 'em.
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: group
Nonsense. Men were wired to fight each other so that women could choose the right mate.

That guy wasn't gay. He had a moustache.

	Speaker: troy	Listeners: jeff
Yeah.
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: jeff

Not a real question, a rhetorical one. You have the answer. He does not. Okay, then you give him the forest Whitaker eye.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: troy
That's pretty good.
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: jeff
Mm-hmm. Okay, hold that stare. There you go. Hold it. Then you look straight through his eyes and deep into his soul.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: jeff troy
And then you move to Vermont.
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: britta
I am sick and tired of you saying that fighting is gay!
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: troy britta
She's got a point. You know, in boxing, you fight for the purse and the belt.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: abed
I've gotta write a paper about that.
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: jeff
All right, I've seen enough. Let's see what we're working with. Go ahead, throw a few at the old paws. What are you, a North Korean seamstress?
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: pierce
Not if that's bad.
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: jeff
Get mad! Come on! If it helps, think of me as somebody who annoys you. Ooh, that's it! That's... that's good.
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: britta
Britta, put your blouse back on.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: self
Oh! Ow!
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: jeff
Boys, this is not a game. You gotta be ready for anything.
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: pierce
Dude, that is not cool!
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: troy
Well, that foxy Black girl thinks it is.
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: self
Hmm? Ow!
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: pierce
What are you doing?
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: pierce
Why does she have to be black?



	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: group
What is going on?
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: shirley
We're trying to get Jeff ready for the fiiiii...iiight.
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: jeff
I couldn't think of another word.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: troy
Idiot.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: shirley
He meant we were figh... ...ting.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: troy
It is hard to think of another word.
	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: jeff
You realize there's no other way for me to take this than as a giant middle finger to the most important day of the year.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: shirley
December 10th?
	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: group
It's our Christmas, and I'm having a party. Due to my divorce and my relatives picking sides, this will be the only Christmas party I throw this year. Will you be there, or will I have another family letting me down?
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: shirley
I told him not to fight. He wouldn't listen. I don't know what that is.
	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: jeff
Jeffrey, I have two boys. And when we have a serious discussion, I find that a brownie helps them to relax. So why do you hate me and Jesus?
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: shirley
I don't think my brownie's working.
	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: jeff
Please don't do something so ugly on a day so important to me.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: shirley
Again, it's December 10th.
	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: jeff
You think religion is stupid?
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: shirley
No, no. To me, religion is like Paul Rudd. I see the appeal, and I would never take it away from anyone. But I would also never stand in line for it. And look, Shirley, the die has been cast with this crazy bully guy. He picked on Abed, and he corrected my Spanish. So you go to your party, and I'll see you soon.
	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: jeff
Jeffrey, I forbid you from fighting.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: shirley
Well, you don't get to. You're not my mom.
	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: jeff
You're right. But if you show up for the fight, don't show up for my party.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: shirley
Oh, come on, Shirley, don't be mad.
	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: jeff
I'm not mad. I'm disappointed.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: shirley
That's "mom" for mad.



	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: annie
Oh, hash browns and applesauce... That's nice.
	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: abed
Oh, what is that interesting smell?
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: shirley
It's a traditional Muslim dish.
	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: abed
It looks delicious. I'm guessing as a woman I won't be allowed to eat that. That's too bad.
	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: britta
Oh, look, Britta brought what she believes in... nothing.
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: britta
Where should I put my Buddha incense holder?
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: pierce
I'm pretty sure that's a bong.



	Speaker: annie	Listeners: group
Where's Jeff?
	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: group
I guess he made his choice.
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: group
I want to go to Jeff's fight.
	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: group
As I told Jeff, no one that goes to the fight can come to my party. He's dead to me. And if any of you leave, you'll be dead to me too. Let's sing. # Jesus is a friend of mine # everybody! # Jesus is a friend of mine # Come on, everybody. You don't know it?
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: shirley
You're banning Jeff from the party? That doesn't seem very Christian.
	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: britta
Well, that's an interesting point of view coming from an atheist.
	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: group
I did my best to create a special Christmas for my one intact family, and... this is the thanks I get.
	Speaker: annie	Listeners: shirley
Shirley, you are a guilt machine.
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: annie
And Annie knows a thing or two about guilt. Am I right, Jew?
	Speaker: annie	Listeners: pierce
Say the whole word!
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: annie
Jewie?
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: pierce
You would never catch a Jehovah's witness saying "Jewie".
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: self
Tell it to the birthday cake you never got.
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: troy
You know, there's an old Buddhist saying in my vision group...
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: pierce
You are not a Buddhist. You are in a cult.
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: britta
Suck it, Nietzsche!
	Speaker: annie	Listeners: group
Guys, everyone's faith is weird. Let's just not talk about it.
	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: group
There's nothing weird about Christianity.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: group
Guys! Guys! Guys! Guys! Are we really gonna let religion divide us like this? I think there's one thing we can all agree on.
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: britta
I get 72 virgins in heaven.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: abed
No.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: group
That we would all like to have Jeff at this party.
	Speaker: annie	Listeners: self
Mm-mm.
	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: britta
He can't come.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: shirley
Shirley.
	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: self
Mm-mm.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: shirley
Shirley, listen. I get that this is your first Christmas since your husband left you, and I don't know, maybe that's why you're being so stubborn, because you're trying so hard to re-create something that you're afraid that you've lost forever. But if you really want us to be your second family, then you've gotta start treating us like one, even if that means supporting us when we do things that you don't agree with. You can start by rooting for Jeff while he rolls around on the ground groping another man. That's what I'm gonna do.
	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: group
The cranberry sauce has real cranberries.



	Speaker: thug	Listeners: extra
Look, if he doesn't show up, We're definitely going to Applebee's, right?
	Speaker: extra	Listeners: thug
Yeah.
	Speaker: thug	Listeners: extra
I'm getting into a fight no matter what today, dude. No matter what! Look who showed. Oh, check him out. Ahh...ahh!



	Speaker: thug	Listeners: jeff
What's up, dude? No backup today? Huh? Looks like grandpa and weirdo couldn't show up to get their teeth knocked out, huh?
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: thug
Can I ask you a question? Are you perpetually on your way to the gym?
	Speaker: thug	Listeners: jeff
Dude, my life is a gym!
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: thug
Well, 'sup?
	Speaker: thug	Listeners: jeff
'Sup, man?
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: thug
'Sup?
	Speaker: thug	Listeners: jeff
'Sup?
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: thug
'Sup? 'Sup?
	Speaker: thug	Listeners: jeff
'Sup? 'Sup?
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: thug
'Sup? 'Sup?
	Speaker: thug	Listeners: jeff
'Sup? 'Sup?
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: thug
'Sup? 'Sup?
	Speaker: thug	Listeners: jeff
Whoa. Dude, what is that?
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: thug
All right, just one sec. These are very expensive. All right...
	Speaker: thug	Listeners: jeff
Dude, you wear a bracelet?
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: thug
Your name's Mike, right?
	Speaker: thyg	Listeners: jeff
So?
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: thug
Mike, I'm not gonna fight you. I have a friend that believes this is the time of year where you put aside your differences, and you make peace. Me... I don't believe in any of that, but I do believe in friendship. And as much as I hate you and the cast of breakin', I have to ask myself, what would Shirley do?
	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: self
Oh!
	Speaker: thug	Listeners: jeff
What would Shirley do?
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: thug
I think...
	Speaker: thug	Listeners: jeff
What would Shirley do?
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: thug
That she would shake your hand and wish you a Merry Christmas.
	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: jeff
Jeffrey... Kick his ass!
	Speaker: thug	Listeners: extra
Cavalry's here. Shirts off, boys!
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: all
Come on, I'm being punked, right?
	Speaker: thug	Listeners: extra
Come here. Come here.



	Speaker: extra	Listeners: shirley
Please, it's Christmas.
	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: extra
It's December 10th!
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: thug
Not the moneymaker. Not the moneymaker!
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: jeff
You're welcome!



	Speaker: annie	Listeners: shirley
Yeah! That was really good.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: shirley
Yeah!
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: shirley
That was nice.



	Speaker: chang	Listeners: group
Thank you, thank you. I get it, yes. It is I, Senior Chang.
	Speaker: chang	Listeners: shirley
Shakira, hold this.
	Speaker: chang	Listeners: group
So... I have finished grading everyone's finals, and all of you are moving on. Heh heh heh, except... for Jeff.
	Speaker: chang	Listeners: jeff
Turns out you... pause for dramatic effect... will be seeing me next semester.
	Speaker: annie	Listeners: self
Noooooooo!
	Speaker: chang	Listeners: group
In Spanish 102! Heh heh heh. Because he passed, you know. And I'm the only Spanish teacher.
	Speaker: annie	Listeners: chang
Yay! I meant about Jeff passing. You being our Spanish teacher, eh.
	Speaker: chang	Listeners: jeff
Whoa. Man, Mike got you good.
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: chang
Actually, uh, that was my present to Jeff.
	Speaker: chang	Listeners: pierce
I don't care. I got a Mountain to shred.
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: jeff
Jeffrey, you're a man now. How's it feel?
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: pierce
I got hit in the face, like, four times before you punched me.
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: jeff
Some people just don't know how to say thank you.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: pierce
Pierce, thank you.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: group
And thanks to all of you for showing up and having my back when we fought those fly dancers. So, uh... Merry...
	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: group
No, no, no, no, no. Holiday.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: shirley
Actually, I was gonna say merry semester and happy new one.



	Speaker: abed	Listeners: troy
Oh Christmas Troy, oh Christmas Troy, thy candles shine so brightly. Oh Christmas Troy, oh Christmas Troy, much pleasure thou canst give me.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: troy abed
Why do you guys do stuff like this?
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: jeff
'cause it's fun?
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: troy
Don't move
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: abed
This nose smells like the special drink
