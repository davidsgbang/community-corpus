Good morning. How do we turn this off? Mother, you think you can come and help me turn it off? How do we turn this off? Can you help me with this? Oh, thank you, thank you so much. I didn't mean to snap. uh, good morning. Many of you are halfway through Your first week here at greendale And as your dean, i thought i would Share a few thoughts of wisdom and inspiration. What is community college? Well, you've heard all kinds of things. You've heard it's "loser college For remedial teens, 20-something dropouts, Middle-age divorcees, And old people keeping their minds active As they circle the drain of eternity." That's what you heard. However, i wish you luck! Okay, you know-- uh-oh. Okay, there's more to this speech. There's actually a middle card that is missing. Can we all look around our immediate areas, 'cause i really wanted to--	|Dean
i'm only half-arabic, actually. My dad is palestinian. he's a u.s. citizen. He's not a threat to national security or anything. A lot of people want to know that after they meet him, Because he has an angry energy. But not, like, angry at america. Just angry at my mom for leaving him. Although she did leave because he was angry And he was angry because she's american. My name's Abed, by the way.	|Abed Jeff

So what is my lawyer doing here?	|Duncan Jeff
i'm a student.	|Jeff Duncan
well, that cannot be an inspiring journey.	|Duncan Jeff

The state bar has suspended my license.	|Jeff Duncan
They found out my college degree Was less than legitimate.	|Jeff Duncan

Waster! not a bathroom! Not a bathroom.	|Duncan Extra
okay. Duncan, you, did seem less into integrity The day that i convinced 12 of yours peers that when you made that u-turn on the freeway And tried to order chalupas from the emergency call box, That your only real crime was loving america.	|Jeff Duncan
Well, I do love America, I do love it, very much. I love chalupas. But, i'll look into it. 	|Duncan Jeff
thank you. Duncan, you are a good man.	|Jeff Duncan
Jeff, are you familiar with the adage, "cheaters never prosper"?	|Duncan Jeff
No, and if i wanted to learn something, I wouldn't have come to community college.	|Jeff Duncan
oh, hey! spanish.	|Jeff Britta

whoa.  I wouldn't dream of it. I just wanted to let you know about my spanish study group.	|Jeff Britta
the guy who's playing bejeweled on his iphone all class has a study group? Um, can i sign up twice?	|Britta Jeff
i'm taking the class as an easy credit. I'm actually a spanish tutor.	|Jeff Britta
Board certified.	|Jeff Britta

Bienvenido.	|Jeff
Bienvenuto! Hey, all right, come on in.  I got the whole table. Welcome.	|Jeff Britta

yeah, i like big talk. what's your deal?	|Jeff Britta
that's not small talk?	|Britta Jeff
what's your deal and is god dead?	|Jeff Britta
all right, you want to know my deal? I dropped out of high-school because I thought for some reason  it would impress Radiohead.	|Britta Jeff
You'd be surprised what gets back to these guys.	|Jeff Britta
I joined the peace corp. I did a little foot modelling, I got tear gased in a World Trade Rally,	|Britta Jeff
Marry me.	|Jeff Britta
And I think, Jeff, my deal is above all else, honesty.	|Britta Jeff
honesty?	|Jeff Britta
yeah. You tell me the truth, i will like you. You lie to me, i will never talk to you again. That's my deal.	|Britta Jeff
ah, that's a good deal.	|Jeff Britta
So what's your deal?	|Britta Jeff
uh, i would have to go-- I would have to say, um, honesty, Because, I would say anything to get what i want. And i want you to like me. So, uh,	|Jeff Britta

Abed in the house!	|Britta Abed
why?	|Jeff Abed
Britta invited me. is that cool?	|Abed Jeff
oh, i can't think of a single logical reason why not.	|Jeff Abed
cool.	|Abed Jeff
there you go. Oh, hey, here. Put your contact info down right there. That's right.	|Jeff Abed
cool, cool, cool. Cool, cool, cool. hey, this is kind of like breakfast club, huh?	|Abed Jeff Britta
we are in a library.	|Britta Abed
yeah. i'm sure we've each got an issue balled up inside of us  that would make us cry if we talked about it.	|Abed Jeff Britta
do you have something balled up inside of you?	|Britta Abed
well, i got a little doozy in the chamber if things get emotional.	|Abed Jeff
Oh. hey, text message. Let's give this bad boy a read.	|Abed Jeff Britta
it's probably just for your eyes.	|Jeff Abed
I've never got one of these	|Abed Jeff Britta
Well, it's just, You probably,  it's probably just for your eyes.	|Jeff Abed
"say you have to pee. i need to talk to you."	|Abed Jeff Britta
"say you have to pee."	|Abed Britta
that is weird.	|Britta Abed
"say you have to pee. I need to talk to you."	|Abed Jeff
do you have to pee?	|Jeff Abed
no.	|Abed Jeff
hmm.	|Jeff Abed
that's so weird.	|Abed Jeff
well, i'm stumped. That's very creepy. That's very creepy.	|Jeff Abed
does it say you have to pee?	|Abed Jeff
no, it's just someone With a misguided grasp of abbreviation.	|Jeff Abed
I just need five minutes, you guys, So go ahead and study all the verbs,in spanish.	|Jeff Abed Britta
Abed,	|Britta Abed
Yeah?	|Abed Britta
What's your read on that guy?	|Britta Abed
You look like Elisabeth Shue.	|Abed Britta
Act natural, pretend you are watching the athletic proceedings.	|Duncan Jeff
I couldn't stop watching them. There's a guy going for the track, that's older than the game of poker. He's kinda cracking.	|Jeff Duncan
suppose i was to say to you It was possible to get those test answers?	|Duncan Jeff
i would say, "go for that," And could have said so in a text.	|Jeff Duncan
i'm asking you if you know the difference Between right and wrong.	|Duncan Jeff
i discovered at a very early age That if i talk long enough, I could make anything right or wrong. So either i'm god or truth is relative. And in either case, booyah.	|Jeff Duncan
oh, interesting. It's just the average person has a much harder time saying, "booyah," to moral relativism.	|Duncan Jeff
duncan, you don't have to play shrink  To protect your pride. I accept. you're chicken.	|Jeff Duncan
Are you trying to use reverse psychology on a psychologist?	|Duncan Jeff
No, I'm just using regular psychology on a spineless, British twit.	|Jeff Duncan
i'm a professor. you can't talk to me that way.	|Duncan Jeff
a six-year-old girl could talk to you that way.	|Jeff Duncan
yes, because that would be adorable!	|Duncan Jeff
No, because you're a five-year-old girl And there's a pecking order.	|Jeff Duncan
fine! i'll do it!	|Duncan Jeff
thank you.	|Jeff Duncan
yeah, pleasure. Bye! Yes! good! Why am i still shouting? I'm drawing attention to myself.	|Duncan Jeff
you guys aren't gonna believe this, But the rest of the group, Is here.	|Jeff Britta Abed
are you the board-certified tutor?	|Pierce Jeff
that means you do my homework, right, Seacrest?	|Troy Jeff
i need to call my babysitter If we're gon' be later than 10:00.	|Shirley Jeff
what board certifies a tutor?	|Annie Jeff
where's Britta?	|Jeff Abed
not sure. But i invited more people from spanish class. Is that cool? 	|Abed Jeff
it's the coolest.	|Jeff Abed
I'm gonna go to the bathroom And bring my jacket, wallet, and keys with me In case there's a fire.	|Jeff Group
should we go with him?	|Shirley Group
i'm leaving my homework with slumdog millionaire over here.	|Troy Group
that's borderline racist, i think.	|Shirley Troy
and busted.	|Britta Jeff
uh, listen.	|Jeff Britta
now you know. I'm a smoker.	|Britta Jeff
yeah, but they're filtered, so that makes them safe.	|Jeff Britta
you ready to get started? Looks like the rest of your group showed up.	|Britta Jeff
yeah, not mine, actually. I think Abed took out a page on craigslist. And i was trained never to say this, But i think that group may be untutorable.	|Jeff Britta
oh, really?	|Britta Jeff
so why don't you and i go study over--	|Jeff Britta
dinner?	|Britta Jeff
or drinks.	|Jeff Britta
i think, actually, we should prioritize here And study first and then go to dinner. And if they really prove to be untutorable, we'll slip out early.	|Britta Jeff
oh,they will be, untutorable.	|Jeff
all right. Look at this crew. All ready to study all night.	|Jeff Group
well, i can stay at least till 10:00.	|Shirley Group
but who studies with strangers, right? My name is Jeff.	|Jeff Group
Jeff, it's a pleasure. My name is Pierce Hawthorne and, yes, That is Hawthorne as in Hawthorne wipes, The award-winning moist towellete.	|Pierce Jeff
i was just going to ask.	|Jeff Pierce
i'm also a toast master, so perhaps I should do the introductions.	|Pierce Group
definitely!	|Jeff Pierce
all right, you already know brittles.	|Pierce Jeff
Britta.	|Britta Pierce
Abed. Abed the arab. Is that inappropriate?	|Pierce Jeff
sure.	|Abed Pierce
roy. roy the wonder boy.	|Pierce Jeff
"Troy".	|Troy Pierce
little princess elizabeth.	|Pierce Jeff
"Annie".	|Annie Pierce
and finally, this beautiful creature is named Shirley.	|Pierce Jeff
is that even close?	|Jeff Shirley
i'd like to know why i had to find out About this group on accident?	|Annie Group
this is getting way more like breakfast club now.	|Abed Group
there's breakfast?	|Pierce Abed
okay, um, maybe we should get started--	|Britta Group
you know, i've been a part of a lot of study groups that fell apart because of unresolved tension. Shouldn't we address Annie's concern?  Did we not invite her?	|Jeff Group
well, Annie, sweetie, it's not behind your back. We just didn't think about,	|Shirley Jeff
can we stop with the "pumpkins" and the "sweeties"? Being younger does not make me inferior. If anything, your age indicates That you've made bad life decisions.	|Annie Shirley
Shirley has a response to that.	|Jeff Shirley
no, no, no. i don't.	|Shirley Jeff
you should. it looks like you do.	|Troy Shirley
please, Shirley.	|Jeff Shirley
okay, okay. I'm sure i've made some bad life decisions And maybe Annie's decisions will be better. But i think she needs to decide Whether she wants to be considered a child Or an adult, because children get pity But not respect. And adults,  they get respect, But they also get the back of they head grabbed  And their face pushed through jukeboxes.	|Shirley Annie
okay. Why don't we try learning "jukebox" in spanish?	|Britta Group
what are you doing?	|Shirley Pierce
Pierce! Let's discuss this creepiness.	|Jeff Pierce
pardon you?	|Pierce Jeff
what are you doing?	|Britta Jeff
i'm certified.	|Jeff Britta
Are you unaware that Shirley Finds your advances inappropriate?	|Jeff Pierce
what advances?	|Pierce Jeff
you have been sexually harassing me Since the very first day of class.	|Shirley Pierce
sexually harassing? what? That makes no sense to me. Why would i harass somebody who turns me on?	|Pierce Shirley
saying she turns you on is the harassment, dude.	|Troy Pierce
hey.	|Pierce Troy
I am a prominent business leader And a highly sought after dinner guest And i will not take courting advice From some teenage boy.	|Pierce Group
well, this teenage boy  is a quarterback and a prom king.	|Troy Pierce
you're not prom king anymore, Troy. This isn't riverside high.	|Annie Troy
how'd you know i went there?	|Troy Annie
because you're still wearing your stupid letter jacket. And more importantly, I sat behind you in Algebra.	|Annie Troy
Wait, you're that girl that got hooked on pills and then dropped out. You're little Annie "Adderall".	|Troy Jeff
Yes, and you are a stupid jock who lost his scholarship by dislocating both shoulders in a keg stand.	|Annie Troy
Keg flip. They're very hard to pull off. You don't know-- I'm a legend.	|Troy Annie
You know what I got for Christmas? It was a banner year at the Bender family. I got a carton of cigarettes. The old man grabbed me, he said, "Hey, smoke up, Johnny!" "No, dad! What about you?"	|Abed Group
Well, uh, that-- That actually was from The Breakfast Club.	|Jeff Abed
Nobody puts baby in the corner.	|Abed Jeff
Dirty Dancing. Hello.	|Jeff Group
It's Professor Duncan. Come to the parking lot now.	|Duncan Jeff
What's wrong with your voice?	|Jeff Duncan
I'm disguising it.	|Duncan Jeff
Uh, I'll be right back. But while I'm gone, you guys need to hash this stuff out. No stone unturned. Go!	|Jeff Group
What does that,	|Pierce Group
I can't feel my,	|Abed Group
Get in the car! Act as if either you have just finished or yet to begin driving. Every answer to every test in your curriculum this semester.	|Duncan Jeff
I knew you could do it, buddy. Thank you.	|Jeff Duncan
Whoa there, grabby-grabby. What do I get?	|Duncan Jeff
The satisfaction of being even.	|Jeff Duncan
Even, fairness, right, wrong. There is no God. Booyah, booyah.	|Duncan Jeff
What do you want from me?	|Jeff Duncan
Your Lexus.	|Duncan Jeff
My car for a semester's worth of answers?	|Jeff Duncan
Will it be just a semester though, Jeff? Won't you be taking the easy way out for the next four years? I want payment in advance. I want leather seats with built-in ball warmers.	|Duncan Jeff
You know, bluffs this weak are how your people lost the colonies.	|Jeff Duncan
Have a nice disbarment hearing.	|Duncan Jeff
What am I supposed to drive?	|Jeff Duncan
Why don't you take this car? It's good for the earth.	|Duncan Jeff
Yeah, so is wiping your butt with a leaf, but it's not how a man gets around! A golf kart!	|Jeff
It is a disaster in there.	|Britta Jeff
Yeah, untutorable. You like Thai food? I love Thai food.	|Jeff Britta
Wait, so, this is a game to you? You put human beings into a state of emotional shambles for a shot at getting in my pants?	|Britta Jeff
Why can't you see that for the compliment that it is? Ok, ok. I'm sorry. It was an accident. I did a little bit of lying  to get close to you. But how was I suppose to know that you were smart and cool, I mean, you look like Elisabeth Shue.	|Jeff Britta
You're unbelievable.	|Britta Jeff
What do you want me to do?	|Jeff Britta
Oh, maybe one decent thing could be to go in there and clean up your mess.	|Britta Jeff
Okay, I am the Barack Obama of this room.	|Troy Group
Okay, if i do that, then dinner, right?	|Jeff Britta
Yeah, fine, whatever. As if there's a dinner on Earth that could make me forget you are a shallow douchebag.	|Britta Jeff
Oh, you're gonna eat those words when you see my new car.	|Jeff Britta
All right, everybody! I want to say something. Everybody, sit down.	|Jeff Group
You don't have to yell.	|Shirley Jeff
You know what makes humans different from other animals?	|Jeff Group
Feet.	|Troy Jeff
No, no, no, come on. Bears have feet.	|Pierce Troy
We're the only species on Earth that observes Shark Week. Sharks don't even observe Shark Week, but we do. For the same reason I can pick up this pencil, tell you it's name is Steve, and go like this. And part of you dies just a little bit on the inside, because people can connect with anything. We can sympathize with a pencil. We can forgive a shark. And we can give Ben Affleck an Academy Award for Screenwriting.	|Jeff Group
Big mistake.	|Pierce Group
He's got a point.	|Troy Pierce
People can find the good in just about anything but themselves. Look at me. It's clear to all of you that I am awesome, but I can never admit that, because that would make me an ass. But what I can do is see what makes Annie awesome. She's driven. We need driven people or the lights go out and the ice cream melts. And Pierce. We need guys like Pierce. This guy has wisdom to offer.	|Jeff Group
The Dalai Lama and I--	|Pierce Group
We should listen to him sometime. We wouldn't regret it. And Shirley. Shirley has earned our respect, Not as a wife, not as a mother, but as a woman. And don't test her on that, because that thing about the jukebox was way too specific to be improvised. And Troy. Who cares if Troy thinks he's all that? Maybe he is. You think astronauts go to the moon because they hate oxygen? No! They're trying to impress their high-school prom king. And Abed. Abed's a shaman. You ask him to pass the salt, he gives you a bowl of soup, because you know what? Soup is better. Abed is better. You are all better than you think you are. You are just designed not to believe it when you hear it from yourself.	|Jeff Group
Soup?	|Pierce Abed
I want you to look to the person to your left. Sorry. Look at the person sitting next to you.	|Jeff Group
Look at her? Okay.	|Shirley Jeff
This?	|Abed Jeff
Yeah.	|Jeff Abed
I want you to extend to that person the same compassion that you extend to sharks, pencils, and Ben Affleck. I want you to say to that person, "I forgive you."	|Jeff Group
I forgive you.	|Shirley Annie
I forgive you.	|Annie Shirley
I forgive you.	|Troy Pierce
You little twerp.	|Pierce Troy
Pierce, I'd like you to say, "I forgive you."	|Jeff Pierce
He didn't say it?	|Shirley Jeff
I forgive you.	|Pierce Troy
You've just stopped being a study group. You have become something, unstoppable. I hereby pronounce you, a community.	|Jeff Group
Oh, that's nice. I like that.	|Shirley Group
This isn't like Breakfast Club anymore. Now it's like Stripes or Meatballs. Anything with Bill Murray, really.	|Abed Jeff
I agree with Abed that tonight has been very special. And now, if you'll excuse me, I have a dinner engagement with Britta. Britta?	|Jeff Group
I lied. Thanks for calming everyone down. but since you're not a Spanish tutor, just a lying creep who purposely upset everyone in an attempt to get with me, I'd appreciate it if you left and stopped wasting all of our time.	|Britta Jeff
Everybody ready?	|Britta Group
Fine.	|Jeff Britta
And I'm happy to report that one of the benefits of being a lying creep is having all the answers to tomorrow's test. And I'm happy to share them with anyone whose time I've wasted more than they've wasted mine.	|Jeff Group
Uh, Jeff, if you have all the answers, why the hell did you start this study group?	|Pierce Jeff
I don't have a study group, Pierce. I made it up.	|Jeff Pierce
What about the "Look Left" speech?	|Annie Jeff
Made it up. That's what I do.	|Jeff Annie
I make things up, and I got paid a lot of money to do it before I came to this school-shaped toilet. I was a lawyer.	|Jeff Group
Oh, God.	|Group
That explains everything.	|Shirley Group
You know, I thought you were like Bill Murray in any of his films, but you're more like Michael Douglas in any of his films.	|Abed Jeff
Yeah?	|Jeff Abed
Yeah.	|Abed Jeff
Well, you have Asperger's.	|Jeff Abed
What did he say?	|Abed Britta
"Ass-burger".	|Troy
It's a serious disorder.	|Annie Troy
It really is.	|Shirley Troy
If it's so serious, why don't they call it meningitis?	|Pierce Annie Shirley
"Ass-burger".	|Pierce
Burger for your ass.	|Troy Pierce
Jeffrey, before you say anything, you may want to think about the gift you've been given.	|Duncan Jeff
An excuse to punch a hippy?	|Jeff Pierce
No. No, not that. An important lesson, my friend. You see, the tools you acquired to survive out there will not help you here at Greendale. What you have, my friend, is a second chance at an honest life.	|Duncan Jeff
Why are people trying  to teach me things At a school that has an express tuition aisle? Give me the keys.	|Jeff Duncan
No, I have to keep your car for-- Don't hit me. Please, don't hit me. Jeffrey, Jeffrey! Are we cool? Are we cool? We're cool.	|Duncan Jeff
I like you, Jeffrey. You remind me of myself at your age.	|Pierce Jeff
I deserve that.	|Jeff Pierce
You know, I've been divorced seven times. Sometimes, I think I'm doing something wrong.	|Pierce Jeff
You keep getting married.	|Jeff Pierce
I never looked at it that way.	|Pierce Jeff
Shouldn't you guys be studying?	|Jeff Pierce Troy
Yeah, things got kind of boring after you left. Let me ask you something. People becloud me for wearing this jacket ever since I got here, but  If I take it off to make them happy, That just makes me weak, right?	|Troy Jeff
Listen, it doesn't matter. You lose the jacket to please them, you keep it to piss them off, Either way It's for them. That's what's weak,	|Jeff Troy
Wow. You just wrinkled my brain, man.	|Troy Jeff
He's good, isn't he?	|Pierce Troy
He's really good.	|Troy Pierce
Shouldn't you be rolling around on a bed covered in test answers?	|Britta Jeff
I don't have any of the answers. I'm gonna-- I'm gonna flunk the test.	|Jeff Group
You just, like, study for, like, an hour. It's not that hard. You seem pretty smart. You got a sports coat.	|Troy Jeff
I am me, Well, the funny thing about being smart is that you can get through most of life without ever having to do any work. So, uh, I'm not really sure how to do that.	|Jeff Group
What's going on? Can you guys hear me? Am I deaf? Can you hear me talking right now?	|Abed Group
Yes.	|Group Abed
That's good.	|Abed Group
You know what? Jeff, actually, we didn't get that far without you, so if you want to come back upstairs--	|Britta Jeff
Really?	|Jeff Britta
Well, it is your study group, so.	|Britta Jeff
Come on, let's study.	|Shirley Jeff
Sounds good.	|Pierce Group
No pressure.	|Troy Jeff
I'm sorry I called you Michael Douglas and I see your value now.	|Abed Jeff
Well, that's the nicest thing anyone's ever said to me.	|Jeff Abed
Community - 1x02 - Spanish 101.HDTV.FXM.en.srt
Good afternoon, Greendale community college. I am your dean with a few corrections to the fall class catalog. Cosmology should be cosmetology, astrology should be astronomy, and the students on the cover should be smiling, but I suppose that's a matter of opinion. Whoever is growing a small patch of cannabis behind the gymnasium, congratulations. You have won a cruise. Report to security to claim your tickets. In order to increase awareness of homelessness, security has been given binoculars. In campus news, the debate over our library's PA system continues with some students suggesting its volume be lowered, while others question its very purpose. More on that story as it unfolds.	|Dean
That dude makes a lot of announcements.	|Troy Group
I like it, it makes every ten minutes feel like the beginning of a new scene of a tv show. Of course, the illusion only lasts until someone says something they'd never say on tv like, how much their life is like tv. There, it's gone.	|Abed Group
I guess Jeff's running late again.	|Annie Group
Oh, What a shame. Maybe we should get started...	|Britta Group
I think we should wait for Jeff before we start studying.	|Shirley Group
But maybe when Jeff gets here, we could talk to him as a group about his tardiness.	|Annie Britta
Don't use that word around Abed. In any case, if you want me to have a chat with Jeff, I'd be happy to do it. We've got a bond going, kind of. Sorta like brothers.	|Pierce Group
I hope your mom didn't make you take baths together 'cause one of you would've been like, 30.	|Troy Pierce
That's funny. You know, Jeff probably comes late so he doesn't have to sit through all of your tardiness.	|Pierce Troy
Sorry, Abed.	|Pierce Abed
Will you guys have some self-respect? You're obsessing over someone who does not give you a second thought. Meanwhile, in Guatemala, journalists are being killed by their own government.	|Britta Group
Baby, you, uh, jumped a column there. What's happening in Guatemala?	|Shirley Britta
Nothing.	|Britta Shirley
Journalists are being murdered?	|Annie Britta
Believe me, every day in that country, people are being killed for speaking out. and the worst part of it is, when it's all over...	|Britta Annie Shirley
Spoilers.	|Abed Britta
It's gonna be as if it never even happened.	|Britta Annie Shirley
Real stories... They don't have spoilers. You understand that TV and life are different, right?	|Britta Annie
My Lady.	|Jeff Annie
My Lord.	|Annie Jeff
Hey, Baby.	|Jeff Shirley
Hi, Sweetie.	|Shirley Jeff
You smell nice. Vitamin P.	|Jeff Pierce
Morning, Jeffrey. People were jazzed to see me too.	|Pierce Jeff
Word 'em up.	|Troy Jeff
Word 'em everywhere.	|Jeff Troy
Good entrance.	|Abed Jeff
That was for you.	|Jeff Abed
I think there's something that the  group would like to talk to you about.	|Britta Jeff
Actually, there's nothing...	|Abed Jeff
If you're gonna study with people, it would be cool of you to show up on time.	|Britta Jeff
Oh. Were you waiting? talking about your interesting personal lives and your cool emotional problems. I just feel like I never have anything to offer. Truth is my life is emptier than this three-ring binder.	|Jeff Group
Annie, Do you have any Spanish notes that might fit in there? Double-spaced. Thank you.	|Jeff Annie
So what's a guy got to do to get a "C" around here?	|Jeff Group
One-liner.	|Troy Group
Good studying. See you later. Bye.	|Abed Group
You know what today is? The two-week anniversary of my horrible first impression.	|Jeff Britta
There's a card for that?	|Britta Jeff
Not specifically, but if you think of grandsons as a metaphor for friendship, I think you'll agree with this transformer here that it's time for ours to become a man. By reading from the Torah.	|Jeff Britta
Look, Jeff. You're harmless enough to me cause a life full of ups and downs has given me douche-ray vision, but those are good people in there, and they trust and respect you. Watching you exploit them, kinda bums me out.	|Britta Jeff
Exploit them? They're my friends.	|Jeff Britta
You want me to bring your car around, Jeff?	|Abed Jeff
No, Abed, I don't want you to bring my car around. I'll bring yours around, good guy. You get going, all right.	|Jeff Abed
You're cute, but selfish and narcissistic to the point of near delusion.	|Britta Jeff
She said I was cute.	|Jeff Britta
Tell you what, you take her. I have less to prove. You can't pursue people so desperately. It starts to creep them out. Why don't we go get a beer? I'll give you some advice, and we can have what the  kids are calling a sausage fest.	|Pierce Jeff
I'm not much of a sausage guy, Pierce. Maybe next time.	|Jeff Pierce
Next time, then.	|Pierce Jeff
Will you tell us more about Guatemala?	|Annie Britta
I never went to a real college.	|Shirley Britta
You should discover that stuff on your own.	|Britta Annie Shirley
But we need your help. We've been living on the wrong side of the looking glass. You're like Jodie Foster or Susan Sarandon. You'd rather keep it real than be likeable.	|Annie Britta
Can you at least tell us what to google?	|Shirley Britta
You could start with this journalist Chacata-Panecos. He wrote an article critical of the government, and they killed him.	|Britta Annie Shirley
That's horrible.	|Annie Britta
Can we have a protest? I want to protest the hell out of something.	|Shirley Britta
We could have a candlelight vigil like lesbians have on the news.	|Annie Shirley
I could make brownies.	|Shirley Annie
Brownies?	|Britta Shirley
Every once in a while, a student come up to me and ask, Why do you teach Spanish?" They say it just like that. "Why do you teach Spanish?" "Why you?" Why not math? Why not photography? Why not martial arts? I mean, surely it must be in my nature to instruct you in something that's ancient and secret like building a wall that you can see from outer space. Well, I'll tell you  why I teach Spanish. It is none of your business, okay? Now, I don't want to have any conversations about what a mysterious and inscrutable man I am. I am a Spanish genius! In espanol, my nickname is "El tigre chino"! 'Cause my knowledge will bite her face off! So don't question Senor Chang or you'll get bit. Ya bit. Ya bit! Friday Manana, we'll be having conversations with the rest of the class using some of the phrases we learned in unit one. You'll be partnering up in pairs of dos. If you look under your desk, you'll find a card with either a picture or a word on it. For ejemplo, blondie aqui has a card with a picture of a house on it. So that means the person with the card with the word casa on it, is her partner. Comprende, Star-burns? See you Friday. Find your partners. Have a great day. And what do we say at the end of every class? Come on, hands... 90 percent of Spanish.	|Chang All
You want to trade cards? I'll give you 20 bucks.	|Jeff Abed
No.	|Abed Jeff
50 bucks.	|Jeff Abed
I don't want your money. I want your shirt.	|Abed Jeff
What?	|Jeff Abed
I've had my eye on it since registration day.	|Abed Jeff
All right, fine. Give me your card.	|Jeff Abed
I don't think you understand. I want to wear it out of here.	|Abed Jeff
What are the odds?	|Jeff Britta
Are you sure you didn't adjust the odds? I know Abed's been eyeing that shirt for three weeks. It's almost like you gave it to him so he would switch cards.	|Britta Jeff
I gave Abed my shirt because I'm not selfish, which is something I guess you'll finally  discover while we are working on this. Tomorrow night? Dinner, drinks.	|Jeff Britta
I think that's something we should discuss with our partners. Oh, see, I did switch cards.	|Britta Jeff
Can you believe this? What are the odds?	|Pierce Jeff
That's a nice shirt. Want to sell it?	|Pierce Jeff
Yes.	|Jeff Pierce
What's the moist towelette industry like? Believe me, it's nothing like the product. Nah. It's a hard, dry, large business. Destroyed all my marriages. Of course it didn't help any that  I can't have children. I'm not sterile. In fact, it's a rare condition they call "hyper-virility". Apparently my sperm shoot through the egg like bullets. Can you believe that?	|Pierce Jeff
I can't. But you can, so that's fine. So, the assignment is to,uh, write a Spanish conversation using those five phrases.	|Jeff Pierce
Hemingway's Lemonade.	|Pierce Jeff
We don't need to make this a long evening. We can just..	|Jeff Pierce
Am I a piece of garbage to you?	|Pierce Jeff
What? No!	|Jeff Pierce
Got ya. Let's have one drink before we work. To the "empowerage" of words.	|Pierce Jeff
To the irony of that sentence.	|Jeff Pierce
So what's up with you, Jeffrey? It seems like you got a burr up your ass or something.	|Pierce Jeff
Well, I guess that it's... I think it's Britta.	|Jeff Pierce
Forget Britta. ...you have to know is her name. What is she, a water filter? She's ugly.	|Pierce Jeff
Why don't we start with me saying...	|Jeff Pierce
What are you doing?	|Pierce Jeff
Our assignment.	|Jeff Pierce
Oh no no no. This is the first time people are gonna see Winger and Hawthorne together. We are gonna show them we're a force to be reckoned with. Come on, let's brainstorm some story ideas. Better yet, before we do that, let's ask ourselves... What is a story?	|Pierce Jeff
Oh, My God in heaven.	|Jeff Pierce
If you like that brownie, you'll gonna hate what's going up on in Guatemala. Google it.	|Shirley Extra
Raise the truth.	|Shirley Britta
Once it gets dark, I hand out the candles and we do  what's called "a speechless protest". We put the tape over our mouths, and gather hand-in-hand in a sea of outraged silence.	|Annie Britta
Starburns, no.	|Britta Starburns
What's gotten into you?	|Annie Britta
This is not how you do this.	|Britta Annie Shirley
We know it's not how you do it cause we're doing everything.	|Annie Britta
But this is tacky and lame. I didn't mean that. I'm sorry. What I meant to say is that this cause is really personal to me.	|Britta Annie Shirley
Are you saying that we're not allowed to protest? Britta, you sound like Guatemala.	|Annie Britta
Sounds like somebody has the case of "likes to use French politics to make themselves special, "but doesn't actually ever want to do anything-itis."	|Shirley Britta
No. I do things. I went to... I don't do anything. What can I do?	|Britta Shirley Annie
You can hang the Chacata-Panecos pinata.	|Annie Britta
You guys realize he was beaten to death, right?	|Britta Shirley Annie
That's where we got the idea from.	|Shirley Britta
Poignant.	|Annie Shirley
Alright, tell me what I've got so far.	|Pierce Jeff
What we have so far? We have something incredibly long, and very confusing, and a little homophobic. And really, really, specifically, surprisingly, and gratuitously critical of Israel. And it's called "two conquistadors", should probably be "dos". I mean, it is a Spanish class. Oh, which reminds me, the only thing not included in this epic are the five phrases required to get me a passing grade.	|Jeff Pierce
You're right. Needs more work.	|Pierce Jeff
What are you guys doing?	|Abed Jeff Pierce
I have no idea.	|Jeff Abed
Well, we're headed to the demonstration.	|Troy Jeff Pierce
What, Hippies?	|Pierce Abed
Some cause Britta's into.	|Troy Pierce Jeff
It's a silent protest. Lots of candles. Gets the ladies in the mood for social  change. If you know what I mean. Good chance to put some miles on this shirt.	|Abed Pierce Jeff
You realize these conversations are due in the morning. Don't you?	|Pierce Troy Abed
Right. What do you want to do?	|Troy Abed
Hola, mi llamo Abed	|Abed Troy
Hola, mi llamo Troy	|Troy Abed
Donde esta la biblioteca?	|Abed Troy
La biblioteca esta en la ciudad	|Troy Abed
Gracias	|Abed Troy
Hacks.	|Pierce Abed Troy
Okay What do we do about the ending of act two?	|Pierce Jeff
I'll tell you what we're gonna do. We're gonna take this, and we're gonna  put it in a museum for crazy people. And then we're gonna take this, and memorize five phrases from it tomorrow morning before class. Good night.	|Jeff Pierce
Wait a minute, Wait a minute, Wait a minute. You're bailing on our first sausage fest? This is your definition of friendship?	|Pierce Jeff
No. This is my definition of you trying way too hard, and me finding it harder  and harder to stay polite. Now this was a fine enough way to spend an evening, devoid of hope, but a woman I kind of like is out there in the moonlight caring about something stupid, and this is my chance to show her that  I care enough to act like I care about it too.	|Jeff Pierce
That's all you had to say, Jeff.	|Pierce Jeff
That was it? That would've been great if I had done that two hours ago!	|Jeff Pierce
Nice sign.	|Britta Jeff
Thanks. I like what you've done with the place.	|Jeff Britta
I think I was a little too harsh on you. I'm not perfect.	|Britta Jeff
I am. I'd be happy to show you the ropes.	|Jeff Britta
Awesome! Look at awesome Jeffrey Winger. Too awesome for old Pierce with your hip shirts, and your gelled hair, and your cool tape over your mouth.	|Pierce Jeff
Why is everybody wearing tape over their mouth?	|Pierce All
It's a protest, Pierce.	|Jeff Pierce
Oh, good. Cause I know what I'd like to protest... How much you hurt me.	|Pierce Jeff
Conflicts like these will ultimately bring us together as an unlikely family.	|Abed Troy
You have horrible breath right now.	|Troy Abed
First, you constantly blow me off, then you want me to do your homework, then you tell me I'm trying too hard to be your friend so you have to go. You have to come out here to pretend to care about the stupid stuff she cares about.	|Pierce Jeff
His words, not mine.	|Pierce Britta
He is paraphrasing.	|Jeff Britta
Pierce, I got an idea. Why don't you go get a cup of coffee, and hold some waitress hostage with a monologue about your sperm.	|Jeff Pierce
I'll show you some sperm, buddy. Was this your idea? What the hell? Fire.	|Pierce Jeff
I'm not ready to die.	|Pierce All
He's jumped in the fountain. He's fine.	|Jeff Britta
Have you seen it?	|Annie Britta
We did it, girl... Page three. Its uh, mostly about Pierce, but listen to that last paragraph.	|Shirley Britta
"The incident occurred during a protest regarding events in Guatemala." Awareness!	|Annie Britta
And this isn't the school paper, by the way. This is a real damn paper, there's a marmaduke in there.	|Shirley Britta
Well, it's more than  I ever accomplished.	|Britta Shirley Annie
Did you guys know about  the ethnic cleansing in Burma?	|Annie Shirley
Need to bust out that brownie mix.	|Shirley Annie
Morning.	|Jeff Britta
Morning.	|Britta Jeff
Oh. no, I get it. Garfield's wishing me a happy Arbor Day, And you'd like a fresh start.	|Britta Jeff
Nice try. It's actually secretary's day, and it says that I'm sorry about crashing your protest with that drunken, self-immolating baby boomer.	|Jeff Britta
We don't blame you, sweetie. Pierce has always been on my watch list.	|Shirley Jeff
That dude is crazy... He told me girls have two pee holes.	|Troy Jeff
I sang Christmas carols at a nursing home once. I've seen the face of dementia, and last night I saw it again.	|Annie Jeff
You know what he did that's really crazy? He offered me $100 to switch cards with him just so he could be partners with Jeff. I think he thought getting closer to Jeff would bring him respect in the group. I think he spent his whole life looking out for himself and he would trade it all for a shot at some kind of family.	|Britta Group
Hola, class. Time for our presentations. First up was supposed to be Jeff and Pierce, but Pierce explained the situation. Apparently there was a falling out, things were said, people were betrayed.	|Chang All
Jeff, having heard Pierce's side of the story, I think the only humane thing to do would be to give you a "C" and let Pierce do his presentation alone, if that sounds fair to you.	|Chang Jeff
That doesn't sound fair to me at all.	|Jeff Chang
Pierce, I understand that if you don't want to be my friend, but this thing we've created... It is bigger than the both of us, and it deserves to be done right.	|Jeff Pierce
All right.	|Pierce Jeff
Okay, guys? Why are there costumes involved? These are short conversations, they're not supposed to take...	|Chang Jeff
Your breath away? Well, tough.	|Jeff Chang
You ready, amigo?	|Jeff Pierce
Si.	|Pierce Jeff
F.	|Chang Jeff
F-minus.	|Chang Pierce
What? Did you say S?	|Pierce Chang
So. That was one of the worst things I have ever seen, which I guess makes being a part  of it, a pretty selfless act, so I'm impressed.	|Britta Jeff
Well, how do you know I didn't do it just to get another shot at you?	|Jeff Britta
Cause a smart guy like you would know that no woman in that class would be able  to look at you as a sexually viable candidate ever again.	|Britta Jeff
No, I know. I thought of that.	|Jeff Britta
She looked back.	|Jeff
You did an all right job  up there, my friend.	|Pierce Jeff
Thanks Pierce	|Jeff Pierce
A couple of notes You got this thing you do with your face when you're trying to be funny that forces people to think about how cool you think you are.	|Pierce Jeff
Donde, esta, la biblioteca. Me llamo T-Bone, la arana discoteca.	|Troy
Discoteca, muneca, la biblioteca. Esta en bigotes grandes, el perro, manteca	|Abed

yeah, he's awesome.	|Extra Jeff
so far so good.	|Jeff Extra
death... So-called... Is a thing that makes men weep. And yet a third of life is spent In sleep. Open your textbooks to page 37. Now...close them and throw them away. Throw it away! Throw it away! For those of you who are new, The motto of this class: carpe diem. "seize the day!" No tests! no papers. You want an "a"? Live in... The moment.	|Whitman All
jackpot.	|Jeff
take off your shoes. Quick. take off your shoes. everyone, take your shoes off. Throw them away. Throw them across the room over there. Today, we learn to walk! Get up and walk out the door! This day could be your last!	|Whitman All
You could die in your sleep.	|Whitman Extra
You could get hit by a bus.	|Whitman Extra
You, that mole is raised and dark.	|Whitman Extra
It's not a good combo.	|Whitman Extra
You are new.	|Whitman Jeff

okay, grandpa.	|Pierce Britta
oh, god bless you, dear.	|Shirley Troy
what's so funny?	|Troy Group
you guys, i found it. the ultimate blow-off class. Professor Whitman. he thinks he's in dead poets society. There's no tests. there's no work. It's just "day seizing." The deadline to enroll is tomorrow. I suggest you all do it.	|Jeff Group
well, some of us are here to actually learn things.	|Annie Jeff
i'm in.	|Troy Jeff
me too. it sounds educational.	|Annie Troy
i'll do it. i love robin williams.	|Shirley Annie Jeff
abed?	|Jeff Abed
not a fan. In every movie, there's an authority figure That gets mad at him for making people laugh.	|Abed Jeff
no, are--are you going to take the class?	|Jeff Abed
oh, can't.	|Abed Jeff
My dad will only pay for classes That will help me run the family restaurant. It's been struggling since 2001. 9/11 was pretty much the 9/11 of the falafel business.	|Abed Group
so your dad has your whole life planned out for you? Are you even interested in falafel?	|Britta Abed
i'm interested in making movies. But my dad says all media's western propaganda That negatively stereotypes arabs.	|Abed Britta
then he should see aladdin. jafar was a bad-ass.	|Troy Group
yes, he was.	|Abed Troy
abed.	|Britta Abed
mm.	|Abed Britta
how much does a film class cost?	|Britta Abed
$70.	|Abed Britta
Britta.	|Jeff Britta
Jeff.	|Britta Jeff
Britta.	|Jeff Britta
isn't abed's dad a hardcore muslim?  They're not as understanding as christians. You can get your head cut off with a salami sword.	|Shirley Britta
Shirley! That's the most racist thing i've ever heard.	|Annie Shirley
Pierce will beat that in one minute.	|Jeff Annie
this is really nice of you.	|Abed Britta
the memo says "for dreams."	|Abed Group
oh!	|Group Abed
you guys, are we going to study spanish Or keep getting involved in each other's personal lives?	|Jeff Group
hey, Troy sneezes like a girl.	|Jeff Troy
and how about i pound you like a boy? That didn't come out right.	|Troy Jeff
why don't you all just leave him alone With his cute little baby sneezes.	|Shirley Group
you're not my mother.	|Troy Shirley
she's not?	|Pierce Troy
29 seconds.	|Jeff Group
what's your name?	|Whitman Shirley
my name is Shirley Bennett.	|Shirley Whitman
Shirley, you get an "a"...	|Whitman Shirley
oh.	|Shirley Whitman
if you can tell me why you are here at greendale.	|Whitman Shirley
what'd i tell you? Okay, but, uh, never again.	|Jeff Troy
Shirley?	|Whitman Shirley
to get a degree in business So i can sell my baked goods and whatnot on the internet.	|Shirley Whitman
why...are you here?	|Whitman Shirley
to get a degree in business So i can sell my baked goods and whatnot on the internet.	|Shirley Whitman
why are you here?	|Whitman Shirley
because i wasted 15 years of my life on a man Who left me with nothing but stretch marks And a foggy memory of two bland orgasms. And now it's time to get what's mine.	|Shirley Whitman
day seized. Only when we stop stopping our lives Can we begin to start starting them. Ms. Edison here, for example, would rather write About what happens to other people Than live what is happening to her.	|Whitman All
i thought there might be a quiz.	|Annie Whitman
well, here's a quiz for you. Why did the pretty young girl die alone Surrounded by sweater-wearing cats Who are trained to use human toilets?	|Whitman Annie
Get up on your desk. Come on. stand on your desk. Up on your desk. She made it! ha ha! Everyone stand on your desks! Up, up, up, up, up! come on. Rise, rise, rise above the programming. All your lives you were told don't stand on your desks. Well, why not?	|Whitman All
ooh! ooh! oh, heaven. My.	|Shirley Extra
she's okay. Go to the nurse. seize the day.	|Whitman All
you know, i was really moved by your honesty earlier. Particularly the part about your husband Not being able, you know...	|Pierce Shirley
your homework. ah. I want you to swim in a lake And tell ten people that you love them.	|Whitman All
Mr. winger, can i have a word, please?	|Whitman Jeff
are you okay.	|Annie Extra
oh, maybe i'm not.	|Extra Annie
hi. Mr. winger, i like to think that every life That passes through this class is changed. But every year, there's always one cocky opportunist Who's just here to coast and grab an easy "a."	|Whitman Jeff
oh, yeah. his name's Pierce. I-i can talk to him for you.	|Jeff Whitman
It's actually you, mr. winger. You have no intention of seizing the day.	|Whitman Jeff
what? listen, i-i have never lived Until i met you. I-i love you. Oh, there's one down. nine to go. Not that i need the grade or even want it!	|Jeff Whitman
well, i'm glad to hear it. Because if you don't genuinely seize the day Before the end of the week, Then you will be seizing an "f" for the semester.	|Whitman Jeff
you... This is no way to teach accounting!	|Jeff Whitman
i have to plan in advance How to prove that i live in the moment. I mean, i'd rather take an actual class, But now it's too late to drop or add.	|Jeff Britta
it is not fair how hard it is for you to cheat here.	|Britta Jeff
hey, how's it going? How's your film class, buddy?	|Britta Abed
it's cool. our first assignment is a documentary. They're like real movies, but with ugly people. I'm learning a lot.	|Abed Britta
that is so wonderful. Some people don't like getting involved In other's lives. I think it's great.	|Britta Abed Jeff
hey, if you're making a documentary About Britta patting herself on the back, You're gonna need a backup battery.	|Jeff Abed Britta
actually, i'm doing a movie about my dad.	|Abed Jeff
that is brilliant. How did he react to you signing up for the film class? that part hasn't happened yet. here he comes.	|Britta Jeff
hey! you want to get involved in my family's business?	|AbedDAD
holy...war.	|Jeff
where do i find mr. Britta?	|AbedDAD Jeff
i'm mr. Britta. That's right. i'm a woman with rights. And you can see my whole face.	|Britta AbedDAD
oh, i get it! Because i'm arab, i must hate women. Let me tell you something, i love women. But i'm getting a major b-word vibe from you.	|AbedDAD Britta
wow, i can't believe i missed out On getting involved in this.	|Jeff AbedDAD
you go host american idol And you stop messing with my son. He's a special boy. I raise him, okay? you don't raise him.	|AbedDAD Britta
raising him means letting him follow his dreams.	|Britta AbedDAD
dreams are for sleeping.	|AbedDAD Britta
you don't know that.	|Britta AbedDAD
it's clinically proven.	|AbedDAD Britta
so's polio.	|Britta AbedDAD
you lost me!	|AbedDAD Britta
abed wants to study film.	|Britta AbedDAD
wait, what is he saying?	|Britta Abed
he says "we're leaving."	|Abed Britta
tell him that you want to stay and study film.	|Britta Abed
i don't think i'm really in the scene.	|Abed Britta
see, it was hard enough to talk to him before. Now we have this between us!	|AbedDAD Britta Jeff Abed
Let's go!	|AbedDAD Abed
hey! hey!	|Britta AbedDAD
hey, don't touch me!	|AbedDAD Britta
guys, guys, stop it. stop it.	|Jeff Britta AbedDAD
you don't touch me!	|AbedDAD Britta
Britta back up. stop.	|Jeff Britta
Sir, you have a right to your faith And your family's privacy. But abed is an adult and a u.s. citizen.	|Jeff AbedDAD
Right?	|Jeff Abed
yeah.	|Abed Jeff
and he has the right to stay.	|Jeff AbedDAD
fine. you want to raise him, you raise him. I'm out!	|AbedDAD Jeff
wait, what?	|Jeff AbedDAD
you know, i had a father like you. And the day i finally cut myself loose is the day i finally started being happy.	|Britta AbedDAD
well, that went well.	|Jeff Abed
i'll have to make some adjustments to my film. Jeff, i think you should play the role of my father.	|Abed Jeff
i don't want to be your father.	|Jeff Abed
that's perfect. you already know your lines.	|Abed Jeff
What? Why are you dressed like an '80s rapist?	|Jeff Britta
professor Whitman comes by here every morning And i need him to see me celebrating life. What's all that?	|Jeff Britta
i am calculating abed's expenses For the semester. You know, there's books. there's meals. He's renting that camera. And, you know, he needs a little spending money.	|Britta Jeff
um, all money is spending money.	|Jeff Britta
Britta, um, it's amazing what you're doing for abed. I mean, a lot of people talk a good game. But you, you follow through. love you.	|Shirley Britta
Shirley, thank you. Bet that doesn't happen to you a lot.	|Britta Shirley
happened yesterday. Shirley's just doing her homework.	|Jeff Britta
hillary, thank you for getting people coffee. I love you.	|Britta Extra
abed, how's it going, buddy?	|Britta Abed
good. my film is coming together.	|Abed Britta
Cool tie, Jeff. Are you wearing that Because you're playing the role of my dad, Or is it really christmas?	|Abed Britta
definitely christmas.	|Jeff Abed
is that a new camera?	|Britta Abed
yeah.	|Abed Britta
It's more expensive, But it lets me adjust really specific settings That most people don't notice or think about.	|Abed Britta
Hi, i would like a latte.	|Abed Extra
And, Jeff, let me get you something.	|Abed Jeff
i'm okay.	|Jeff Abed
oh, come on. i got you.	|Abed Jeff
no, really. i don't need anything.	|Jeff Abed
no, really. you're insulting me. Look at all this cash.	|Abed Jeff
okay, i will get a small, black coffee.	|Jeff Abed
boo. an ordinary coffee for an ordinary life.	|Whitman Jeff
good morning, professor Whitman.	|Jeff Whitman
sorry, mr. winger, these won't cut it.	|Whitman Jeff
shazbot!	|Jeff
i shall have... A birthday cake!	|Whitman Extra
i've seen men in your situation, Troy. No, those are both for me. You were on top of the world before And now no one gives a rat's ass. I can help you with your image. First, lose the jacket. You look like a high school bitch. But more importantly, it's your sneeze. When i was a ceo, I had an array of masculine sneezes That asserted dominance. You know, like, the explosive, Shock-the-room-into-silence sneeze. Or the draw-them-in sneeze. You know... And maybe i wouldn't sneeze because i'm in control. You could even use a sneeze to drive home a point even. Like, i think-- i think the cubs Are going to win it all this year. What do you think?	|Pierce Troy
tell me more.	|Troy Pierce
it's showtime.	|Jeff
Hey, everybody. good morning. Good morning, sir. Good morning, greendale! hi! good morning! Watch the kite. uh-oh. Mind if i get a chance? oh! Look at this. one foot. Thanks, you guys. bring it in here. Nice. thank you so much, you guys. That was really fun.	|Jeff All
sloppy. And considering the age of these girls, Unwittingly creepy.	|Whitman Jeff
damn it.	|Jeff Whitman
Beat it.	|Jeff Extra
Professor, will you look at the amount of work That i'm putting into this? I mean, throw me a bone!	|Jeff Whitman
had i not already cried at the sunrise this morning, I would be weeping right now.	|Whitman Jeff
what does that mean?	|Jeff Whitman
what do you mean, Jeff? What does your life mean? How long does it take you in the morning To--to make it look like you have bed head? How many sweat pants, sport jacket combos did you try Before you found the one that said "i don't care"? Seize the day, Jeff, for real. Go running naked in a hailstorm, Kiss a girl in the middle of the day, Fly a kite, but do it for yourself. Or you won't just fail my class, You'll fail life.	|Whitman Jeff
thank you.	|Britta Whitman
That guy's really got your number.	|Britta Jeff
drop the flower.	|Jeff Britta
look, i really need to talk to you about abed. I went by his film class today. he wasn't there. He's cutting. I want to know why he would do something like that.	|Britta Jeff
ask him.	|Jeff Britta
every time i try to ask him about it, He just keeps filming me and telling me That i'm playing the role of his mother.	|Britta Jeff
abed is not normal. That's what you bought When you intentionally tangled yourself in his life.	|Jeff Britta
look, will you just-- will you please talk to him?	|Britta Jeff
i've got problems of my own! I'm out here trying to seize a day!	|Jeff Britta
What in the hell? Is he gonna kill us?	|Jeff Britta
thanks for the pizza, abed. i was starving.	|Troy Abed
yeah, it's nice. like a--like a picnic.	|Shirley Abed
or a family dinner.	|Pierce Abed
it's a study group and a pizza. Let's not get carried away.	|Jeff Group
so, abed, how's film class?	|Jeff Abed
good.	|Abed Jeff
yeah? did you go to class today?	|Jeff Abed
not really.	|Abed Jeff
not really. Well, Britta's paying for those classes. Don't you think maybe you should go?	|Jeff Abed
i was shooting my movie.	|Abed Jeff
yeah, but your movie's for class.	|Britta Abed
my movie's more important.	|Abed Britta
well, ooh la la.	|Britta Abed
someone order seven lattes?	|Extra Group
i got that.	|Abed Extra
no, you don't got it. I got it, abed. i got everything. What is wrong with you? All i want to do is take care of you. I know you're not stupid. are you doing this on purpose? Why won't you answer me?	|Britta Extra
'cause this is the scene where you leave.	|Abed Britta
you better believe it.	|Britta Abed
Britta.	|Jeff Abed
what do you think, dad?	|Abed Jeff
i think you are really weird, abed. And i think the wrong person just left.	|Jeff Abed
perfect. that's a wrap.	|Abed Group
that guy was your dad?	|Extra Abed
hey.	|Jeff Britta
hey. You don't really have tickets for ravi shankar, do you?	|Britta Jeff
i lied to get you here Because it's time to communicate.	|Jeff Britta
communicate. have you met abed?	|Britta Jeff
it's not the two of you that need to talk.	|Jeff Britta
hey, wait a minute, where's weezer?	|AbedDAD Jeff
they're coming.	|Jeff AbedDAD
All right, now, the only reason Why this whole mess got started Is because both of you wanted the best for abed. And i think the lesson we can all take away from this Is that everyone should always do Whatever they want and leave each other out of it.	|Jeff AbedDAD Britta
is that your take? let me give you mine. You and your pillow-lipped girlfriend Got all up in my stuff because you wanted to be cowboys And then you turned chicken when you found out It will take more than speeches and guided missiles.	|AbedDAD Jeff Britta
interesting. hadn't seen the iraq metaphor, but--	|Jeff AbedDAD
what iraq metaphor? I am talking about your speeches And her guided--	|AbedDAD Jeff
got it!	|Jeff AbedDAD
The point is is that Britta is sorry, right?	|Jeff Britta
wrong.	|Britta Jeff
crap.	|Jeff
abed may not be a great filmmaker, But that doesn't mean that he wants to make falafel. You need to let him make his own decisions.	|Britta AbedDAD
make his own decisions? Have you met abed? you know who he is?	|AbedDAD Britta
guys.	|Jeff Britta AbedDAD
yes.	|Britta AbedDAD
guys!	|Jeff Britta AbedDAD
he loves--	|AbedDAD Britta
i'm finished.	|Abed Jeff Britta AbedDAD
Britta, Jeff, dad.	|Abed Jeff Britta AbedDAD
how's it going, buddy?	|Britta Abed
i don't want to be your father. I think you are weird, abed.	|Abed Jeff
okay, look, i need to talk to you about abed.	|Britta Jeff
he's not normal.	|Jeff Britta
what is wrong with you? All i want to do is take care of you. Why will you not answer me?	|Britta Abed
what do you think, dad?	|Abed Jeff
i think you are weird, abed. And i think the wrong person just left.	|Jeff Abed
it's not exactly citizen kane.	|Jeff Britta
i feel a little out of the loop here.	|Britta Jeff
that feeling is called the joy of freedom.	|Jeff Britta
my son is hard to understand. If making movies help him be understood, Then i pay for the class.	|AbedDAD Jeff Britta
i made this all happen.	|Britta Jeff
with falafel as a fallback.	|AbedDAD Jeff Britta
abed.	|Britta Abed
yeah.	|Abed Britta
did you do all of that to me on purpose? That's not a very nice way to treat your friends.	|Britta Abed
well, Britta, it isn't called friend business, It's called show business.	|Abed Britta
he's smoking.	|Britta Jeff
honey, let him leave the nest.	|Jeff Britta
get your hand off my knee.	|Britta Jeff
sorry.	|Jeff Britta
god--god bless you. god bless you.	|Shirley Troy
thank you.	|Troy Shirley
for someone who doesn't like getting involved, Well, i owe you.	|Britta Jeff
you owe me. That cannot be comfortable for you.	|Jeff Britta
hey, um, you should kiss me right now.	|Britta Jeff
day seized!	|Whitman Jeff
we're even.	|Britta Jeff
"a" plus, winger. I know a life-changing kiss when i see one. Wowee! ha ha!	|Whitman Jeff
yeah. fooled you.	|Jeff Britta
am I krumping?	|Abed Troy
no.	|Troy Abed
am I krumping?	|Abed Troy
no.	|Troy Abed
am I krumping now?	|Abed Troy
no.	|Troy Abed
am I krumping now?	|Abed Troy
No! This is krumping.	|Abed Troy
We are krumping.	|Troy Jeff
No you are not	|Jeff Troy

Before we wrap up, i would like to thank you guys For filling out these anonymous evaluation cards. I found your feedback To be largely constructive and flattering, So gracias on that.	|Chang All
De nada.	|Abed Chang
You don't have to sign your name anymore.	|Chang Abed
Got it.	|Abed Chang
But there was one evaluation That was so harsh and hurtful And racist That i took the time personally To analyze that handwriting against past exams. And this particular coward Dots her is with tiny, Itty-Bitty, little circles. Boop. Boop. Tcch! Isn't that precious and cute? Who's "erratic and unstable" now, Princess Gringa?	|Chang Annie
Nice day out today, isn't it?	|Shirley Jeff
Yeah. Shoot!	|Jeff Shirley
You forget something?	|Britta Jeff
Yeah. I forgot to stagger the timing of my exit with shirley's. We both have a class across campus, and i can't go That kind of distance with "ooh, that's nice."	|Jeff Britta
That's mean.	|Britta Jeff
No. that's not nice.	|Jeff Britta
I find shirley very easy to talk to, And besides, aren't you supposed to have, Like, an olympic gold medal in jibber-Jabber?	|Britta Jeff
Yeah, but i'm a sprinter. I am at my best during high-Speed bursts of wit. On a shirley walk, i'd be winded by that stoner tree.	|Jeff Britta
Hey, britta, hi. What's up?	|Vaughn Britta
Hey, vaughn, how's it going?	|Britta Vaughn
No worries.	|Vaughn Britta
Interesting. 'Cause i might be worried If i was playing hacky sack a decade too late.	|Jeff Britta
My class is that way.	|Britta Jeff
All right, but i just wanted to point out That we easily walked more than 100 yards With no awkward pauses, And that is the sign of a true friend.	|Jeff Britta
I am really glad that you're not hitting on me anymore.	|Britta Jeff
There's the awkward pause.	|Jeff Britta
Excuse me. Oh, sorry, ladies.	|Annie Extra
Professor duncan! Professor duncan!	|Annie Duncan
What?	|Duncan Annie
Excuse me. Annie edison. I am in your 101 lecture.	|Annie Duncan
Hello.	|Duncan Annie
I've heard about your special psych lab.	|Annie Duncan
Ah. The duncan principle.	|Duncan Annie
Yes. And i know it's limited to second-Year students, But i had a 4.0 at riverside high, And i'm not looking down on this school at all, But i'm only here because of a brief addiction to pills That i was told would help me...focus, But they actually made me lose my scholarship and virginity. So--	|Annie Duncan
Right.	|Duncan Annie
If you would let me take your lab early, It would be a real feather in my transcript.	|Annie Duncan
Okay, i've actually been in this situation many times, So i'm just going to be up front. I am not allowed to date students.	|Duncan Annie
Oh!	|Annie Duncan
Even though you're an eight.	|Duncan Annie
Oh!	|Annie Duncan
Which is a british ten, So i'm angry.	|Duncan Annie
Oh!	|Annie Duncan
But if, in spite of that, you are still interested, Then you may join the lab. Ah! Okay. You need to bring two human subjects. And it would not hurt your chances one bit If you could lend me a fiver. I seem to have left my purse in my duffle And my duffle in the boot of my lorry, so--	|Duncan Annie
Oh.	|Annie Duncan
I asked politely, and then panda took his pants off.	|Vaughn Britta
I never even knew that's what asexual meant.	|Britta Vaughn
I wonder what this express package could be? Somebody had to get something to me very fast.	|Pierce Group
You brought your mail to campus?	|Shirley Pierce
Oh, yes. My ear-Noculars.	|Pierce Group
What is that? It looks like your bluetooth thingie.	|Troy Pierce
No, no, no, no, no. This is my cell phone headset. And this is ear-Noculars. It's for spies and whatnot. It gives you sonic hearing.	|Pierce Troy
All hearing is sonic.	|Abed Pierce
What's that?	|Pierce Group
So who wants to be in a psych experiment?	|Annie Group
Hey, guys, guys, guys? Annie is talking about some kind of experiment.	|Pierce Group
She's behind you. Not interested.	|Jeff Pierce
Please? You get paid.	|Annie Group
Do they do stuff to your butt?	|Troy Annie
No.	|Annie Troy
Do you get paid more if they do stuff to your butt?	|Troy Annie
No.	|Annie Troy
That's fine. I will do it. I am in.	|Troy Annie
Yay!	|Annie Troy
How about you, abed? It's tomorrow.	|Annie Abed
Ooh, tomorrow? They're showing all four indiana joneses at the vista. I am really looking forward to the first three. I bought a whip.	|Abed Annie
This is really important to me, abed. Could you please go as my friend? My really good friend?	|Annie Abed
Wow, i didn't realize we were really good friends. I figured we were more like chandler and phoebe. They never really had stories together. Sure, i'll do it, chandler.	|Abed Annie
Oh, thank you, abed.	|Annie Abed
Oh!	|Shirley Abed
I am gonna go save britta from that dude.	|Jeff Group
Yeah, she looks like she's in trouble.	|Shirley Jeff
Hope he doesn't try to "handsome" her to death.	|Shrley Group
And panda has no pants.	|Vaughn Britta
Hey.	|Jeff Britta
Hey, hi, what's up, man? I am vaughn.	|Vaughn Jeff
You in line?	|Jeff Vaughn
Oh, no, no, no. We're just, uh, we're just chillin'. Hey, you're not gonna order coffee?	|Vaughn Jeff
Oh, no, i was just gonna see if britta--	|Jeff Vaughn
Hey, no judgment, bro. I used to do coffee. Then i made the switch to green tea. It's, like--It's, like, Filled with these antioxidants and stuff.	|Vaughn Jeff
Hmm.	|Jeff Vaughn
It's pretty tight.	|Vaughn Jeff
Tight. Yes. I've heard that about green tea.	|Jeff Vaughn
I like green tea. I should make the change.	|Britta Vaughn
Up top, sugar bear.	|Vaughn Britta
Yeah, give me some of that.	|Jeff Vaughn
There it is.	|Vaughn Jeff
Small coffee, please.	|Jeff Extra
Britta's making the change to green tea.	|Pierce Group
Oh, that's good. It's good for your skin.	|Shirley Group
Welcome, research assistants. If you turn your attention to the monitor, You will see that our subjects Are waiting for the experiment to begin, but... It's actually happening right now.	|Duncan All
Wow.	|All Duncan
You see, the waiting is the experiment. The duncan principle is simple. Namely, that the more control lost by the-- Yeah, i'm gonna write this down too, actually. That's a good point. The more control lost by the ego, The more gained by the id, Resulting in a surprisingly predictable Emotional eruption or breaking point, Known to ma and pa as a good old-Fashioned tantrum. Oh.	|Duncan All
Annie, why don't you, uh, go and tell our subjects That we're going to be starting the experiment In five minutes, okay? And annie... It's never actually going to start.	|Duncan Annie
Ho ho.	|Garrett All
Let's do this.	|Duncan All
Hi, everyone.	|Annie All
Hi, troy.	|Annie Troy
Hi, abed. Hi.	|Troy Annie
Hi, senor chang.	|Annie Chang
What, a community college spanish teacher Can't use 80 bucks?	|Chang Annie
Well, we're just running a little bit behind, So we'll probably start in about five minutes.	|Annie Chang
No, no, no! No, no, no, no, no! It's unacceptable, all right? You lied to me! When you say something starts at 9:00, It starts at nueve!	|Chang Annie
No! No!	|Chang All
Houston, we have an idiot.	|Duncan All
Did you know we walk the same way after class? I am sure you didn't or else we would've been walking together, Unless you're a jerk. Just kidding.	|Shirley Jeff
Let's do it.	|Jeff Shirley
Mm-Hmm. Don't go too fast for these dogs. Short legs. So how do you like--	|Shirley Jeff
So you've got a kid, right?	|Jeff Shirley
What's that?	|Shirley Jeff
Nothing.	|Jeff Shirley
So pierce isn't exactly right in the head, is he?	|Shirley Jeff
I know a lot of grown men With radar dishes coming out of their ear.	|Jeff Shirley
he's like inspector gadget.	|Shirley Jeff
Yeah, go, go, gadget incontinence.	|Jeff Shrley
And how about that guy that's always around, flirting with britta?	|Shirley Jeff
I know! He's the worst! Vaughn?	|Jeff Shirley
I know, and what is it with his hair?	|Shirley Jeff
It's perpetually moist.	|Jeff Shirley
Okay, we're three hours in, so let's review what we've seen. And pay close attention to every subject's breaking point. We've got a shouter. That one's a stomper. Bye, hippie. There's a generic whack job, bouncing up and down Like a six-Foot child. Shaking. Write that down. Visible shakes. Look at the little one chase the big one. Look at him go. I am gonna make him go quicker. It's like benny hill looks. Whoo, ooh, ooh, get him. Come back again. Whoo, ooh, ooh, get him. All right? There's a bit of fun. It lightens the mood. And back to the present. And then there were two. Break.	|Duncan All
No, no, no! Annie! What is going on in there? Why--? What is taking so long? I've wasted all day here for you. The soul train awards were tonight. You promised butt stuff!	|Troy Annie
And he's out. We got him. strike three. You're gone.	|Duncan All
There's so much dust in here.	|Troy
Do you know what? The longer they wait, the harder they break. Buckle up, students.	|Duncan All
Do you see how often hacky sack takes his shirt off? He'd play shirts and skins in a game of checkers.	|Shirley Jeff
I am so glad to be able to talk to someone about this. I wanted to say something to britta about it, But we're supposed to be friends now, And she'd think i was jealous.	|Jeff Shirley
I don't see why you and britta aren't together. Two cute white people, going to school together, Just seems right.	|Shirley Jeff
Shirley, we're not pandas in a zoo.	|Jeff Shirley
Oh. Oh, dear.	|Shirley Jeff
That is not what i want to see.	|Jeff Shirley
There goes the shirt.	|Shirley Jeff
Hey.	|Britta Jeff
Hey, i'm fine. How are-- Want me to, uh, Want me to check you for grass stains?	|Jeff Britta
I wasn't sure how or when to bring up That i was hanging out with vaughn. I figured that you'd make fun of him...and me.	|Britta Jeff
Uh, first of all, Friends do not make fun of each other, Even if they're being tackled in the quad by a hippie, And secondly, vaughn seems cool.	|Jeff Britta
Well, you guys should hang out sometime. I gotta go. I--Uh, that was tacky out there. You won't ever see that again.	|Britta Jeff
Oh, no worries, brah.	|Jeff Britta
Shirley, did you see senor chang's socks today? Tiny bullfighters.	|Jeff Shirley
I can top that. Did you see that hacky sack wears an anklet? Since when won't you talk about vaughn?	|Shirley Jeff
Look, i'm trying to be a good friend to britta. She thought i was gonna make fun of him, But i want to be unpredictable. I am gonna show her that i am not the jerk she thinks i am And friend the hell out of That green-Tea-Drinking drum circler.	|Jeff Shirley
Okay, but tell me you've noticed How small his nipples are.	|Shirley Jeff
Not engaging.	|Jeff Shirley
What? It's not gossip when it's fact. My kids have got hamsters with bigger nips.	|Shirley Jeff
No!	|Jeff Shirley
Oh, well.	|Shirley Jeff
No!	|Jeff Shirley
Jeff!	|Shirley Jeff
Is it on pause?	|Duncan Annie
No, that's just him.	|Annie Duncan
Sorry you've been waiting 26 hours. It's just gonna be another five minutes.	|Annie Abed
Okey-Dokey.	|Abed Annie
Oh, my... Why won't he leave?	|Duncan
Professor.	|Garrett Duncan
What?	|Duncan Garrett
I am sorry, but this guy's not moving. I have classes to go to.	|Garrett Duncan
Go! Fine! Go kill john lennon again, you loser.	|Duncan Garrett
He's ruined my study! He has--He has warped the duncan principle. Damn you, you outlying piece of datum! ow! Aah!	|Duncan
It's you! It's your fault!	|Duncan Annie
But you told me to bring subjects.	|Annie Duncan
Yeah, subjects! Not rain man! I should never have let you into this lab, Miss annie fanny panties in a bunch!	|Duncan Annie
Oh! Oh, that's so hilarious! Did you think of that The last time you skipped a trip to the dentist?	|Annie Duncan
Oh, let me answer that question with another question.	|Duncan Annie
It's not--It's not fair! It's not fair! Why, why, why? What are you doing? Put your-- Stop writing! Put your pen-- Give me that! Get out! Get out, you dorks! Get out!	|Duncan All
You have destroyed the duncan principle!	|Duncan Annie
Go home!	|Annie Troy
Cool. See ya.	|Troy Annie
So britta said that you did a lot of community service.	|Jeff Vaughn
Ultimate frisbee at the senior's center. It is amazing.	|Vaughn Jeff
And what makes frisbee ultimate?	|Jeff Vaughn
Aw, man, if i had a nickel For every time i wished somebody asked me that.	|Vaughn Jeff
I am gonna get dessert. Want anything?	|Britta Vaughn Jeff
Carrots.	|Vaughn Britta
Oh, i'm good.	|Jeff Britta
Hey, you two.	|Shirley Jeff Vaughn
Hey.	|Vaughn Shirley
Well, that's a cool shirt.	|Shirley Vaughn
Thank you. Thank you very much.	|Vaughn Shirley
Where's it from?	|Shirley Vaughn
Oh, uh, i don't even know. I guess it's-- Well, uh-- Hey, look at that. "Hanes classic."	|Vaughn Shirley
Oh, that's nice.	|Shirley Vaughn
You know, people underestimate the elderly, You know, but you see these guys out there And they're throwing the bee And they're just loving life. It's just inspiring.	|Vaughn Jeff Shirley
You know, i'm gonna really-- I am gonna think about it.	|Jeff Vaughn
All right. I am gonna go check on britts. See ya.	|Vaughn Jeff Shirley
See ya.	|Shirley Vaughn
You are the devil.	|Jeff Shirley
I know.	|Shirley Jeff
Donde vaughn ustedes los sabados?	|Jeff Shirley
Domingo, pl-- Oh, okay, I--	|Britta Jeff
Where do we go on saturdays? You said sunday.	|Jeff Britta
I have a question for you. You like vaughn, right?	|Britta Jeff
Oh, he--He's very cute.	|Jeff Britta
I am just worried That he's thinking a little bit more intensely About this thing than i am. He says stuff, you know, after...	|Britta Jeff
School?	|Jeff Britta
After...	|Britta Jeff
Dinner mints?	|Jeff Britta
After...	|Britta Jeff
Not having sex?	|Jeff Britta
Ahh...	|Britta Jeff
How was that?	|Jeff Britta
What? Forget that. The problem right now is that he's calling me "babe." He's trying to hold my hand. It's getting a little relationship-Y. And he gave me something.	|Britta Jeff
Herpes?	|Jeff Britta
No. This.	|Britta Jeff
A poem?	|Jeff Britta
How do i respond to something like that? "Thank you"?	|Britta Jeff
Well, it's a very good question. And it's one i will answer. Uh-- Ooh, i'm getting a text. I am just gonna read it, if you don't mind. I am reading it, and it is read.	|Jeff Britta
"Did you ever notice where the ocean meets the sky, did ya? It's the same wizard blue that i see in your eye, brit-Ta."	|Jeff Shirley
Oh, no, no. "Wizard blue"?	|Shirley Jeff
Yeah.	|Jeff Shirley
Thank you so much. You just brightened my day. I am so glad we can rip on that dude again.	|Shirley Jeff
Look at this, look at this. That is the stain of a teardrop over the word "rad."	|Jeff Shirley
Oh, he said "rad"? I thought he said "bad." Oh, that makes it worse.	|Shirley Jeff
I am surprised he can read.	|Jeff Shirley
Oh!	|Shirley Jeff
You know?	|Jeff Shirley
I know.	|Shirley Jeff
Hey, sorry about bailing on the psych experiment.	|Troy Annie
That was the experiment, troy. We were testing to see how long people would wait in the room.	|Annie Troy
Whoa.	|Troy
Oh, gotcha.	|Abed Annie
"Gotcha"? That's all you have to say?	|Annie Abed
Yeah.	|Abed Annie
You sat in a room for 26 straight hours. Didn't that bother you?	|Annie Abed
Yeah, i was livid.	|Abed Annie
Then why didn't you leave?	|Annie Abed
Because you asked me to stay and you said we were friends.	|Abed Annie
Wait. Is this still part of the experiment?	|Troy Annie
He's more like a puppy with a fish mouth.	|Jeff Shirley
Right, right. It's more like this.	|Shirley Jeff
That's right. Laugh it up. You guys want to know what they're doing?	|Pierce Group
Yeah.	|Abed Pierce
Sure.	|Troy Pierce
Making fun of all of us.	|Pierce Group
I heard you with my own ear...noculars.	|Pierce Jeff
Pierce, we are not making fun of you.	|Jeff Pierce
Uh-Huh. Calling me "hacky sack" And ripping my--My six pack abs and my moist hair.	|Pierce Annie
And that face you made? Well, i think it's pretty obviously annie.	|Pierce Shirley
Okay, this is definitely still part of the experiment.	|Troy
Pierce, we were not making fun of you.	|Jeff Pierce
Yeah.	|Shirley Pierce
We're making fun britta's boyfriend, vaughn.	|Jeff Pierce
Oh, good. Well, in that case. But if we're gonna do something, let's do it as a team. I will get the ball rolling. Maybe he has a tiny penis.	|Pierce Jeff Shirley
Who is this guy?	|Troy Group
You all have got to see him. Everything's all, "no worries, no worries." And he always says hello three times in a row. Hello, good evening, how are you? And--Here, look! He wrote a poem!	|Shrley Group
Community - 1x05 - Advanced Criminal Law.HDTV.FQM.en.srt
good morning, greendale community college. This is your dean reminding you That among your school's prestigious alumni Is mr. luis guzman, celebrated actor And model puerto-rican american. This friday, we will be dedicating a statue of guzman And unveiling our brand-new school song. So boy, i don't know about you, But this sure feels like a real college to me.	|Dean
greendale, greendale, Greendale!	|DeanBot
ah! Jeff, Jeff. Good morning! How is student life, my dry-witted friend?	|Duncan Jeff
probably the same as teacher life, But less tragic, because i get to leave.	|Jeff Duncan
very dry. very witty. Not a great friend. Listen, i wanted to ask you about that young lady In your spanish class. You know, the blonde with the pouty, strident Cate blanchett sexuality and the ridiculous name?	|Duncan Jeff
Britta?	|Jeff Duncan
that's it, that's it. Imagine living with that. can you imagine? Unbelievable. Anyway, are you two an item, and if so, Would that item be impervious to sabotage?	|Duncan Jeff
you know, you have the savoir faire of a hyena. How is it that you and james bond Come from the same island?	|Jeff Duncan
message received. I'll just wait for you to finish striking out first. cheers.	|Duncan Jeff
m.a.s.h.	|Abed Duncan
fawlty towers. game over.	|Duncan Abed
Have a nice day.	|Duncan Jeff
do you think luis guzman Will ever come to visit his statue? If so, i'd like to ask him about his movie choices, particularly carlito's way, the cowboy way, the hard way, and q&a.	|Abed Troy
yeah, luis guzman is on a private jet from hollywood, Because he can't wait to have that conversation with you.	|Troy Abed
really? how does he know about me?	|Abed Troy
because he called me on my cell phone.	|Troy Abed
why would a movie actor call you?	|Abed Troy
you don't know?	|Troy Abed
no.	|Abed Troy
i'm president obama's nephew.	|Troy Abed
you never mentioned that.	|Abed Troy
i didn't know if i could trust you. But now it's time to tell you everything-- Starting with me inventing the ferrari.	|Troy Abed
so...i guess the cell phone number You put on the study group's contact sheet was fake, Which i just learned in the awkward conclusion Of a month-long text message affair with a dude from boulder.	|Jeff Britta
sorry.	|Britta Jeff
that's okay. Just give me your real number. I'll cleanse my palate while kevin rethinks his marriage.	|Jeff Britta
I'll give you my number if you promise not to use it In any other context than friendship.	|Britta Jeff
uh...pass.	|Jeff Britta
silencio, por favor.	|Chang All
Star burns-- that means you.	|Chang Starburns
my name's alex, dude.	|Starburns Chang
well, maybe you should spend five hours Sculpting that in your face.	|Chang Starburns
All right, last night i graded your tests. I'm sure you wanna know how you did, right?	|Chang All
yes, i would.	|All Chang
well, i'm not gonna tell you. Until i find out who did...this!	|Chang All
what is that?	|Shirley Chang
it's a tiny piece of paper, okay? That's all it is. tiny piece of paper.	|Chang Shirley
Containing all the information covered on the test. Otherwise known as a crib sheet. Who did it, huh?	|Chang All
Marianne?	|Chang Annie
grandpa?	|Chang Pierce
Jackee?	|Chang Shirley
Kumar?	|Chang Abed
There's one asian stereotype that does apply to me. Whoever did this insulted my honor. And they've got 24 hours to come forward, Or mr. miyagi here will wax off everyone's score and the whole class gets a cero!	|Chang All
'cept you, toby.	|Chang Extra
the only difference between senor chang and stalin Is that i know who senor chang is.	|Troy Group
did you hear him call me jackee Like i'm some black female caricature? If the good lord hadn't been watching, I'd have slapped him upside the head.	|Shirley Group
who do you guys think cheated?	|Pierce Group
flattering. But if i'm gonna cheat, I'm not gonna write information from a book Onto a piece of paper. That's practically learning, for god's sakes. Whoever made that crib sheet wasn't a real cheater. Just...insecure and naive.	|Jeff Group
i may be naive, but i'm not stupid.	|Annie Jeff
well, i may be stupid, But i'm not trying to look like i'm not.	|Troy Annie
well, i may be a genius, but i'm not a lesbian.	|Pierce Britta
Who cares who made the crib sheet? The only real cheater Is the guy who's threatening everyone with a zero.	|Britta Group
you're right! it's so unfair. And i can't handle this kind of stress right now. I'm already overwhelmed by my duties On the school song committee.	|Annie Group
are you a musician?	|Pierce Annie
eew. no. i hired a local composer. But he's quite a handful.	|Annie Pierce
well, i guess that's your fault, isn't it?	|Pierce Annie
it is?	|Annie Pierce
you've got an accomplished Pianist and songwriter sitting 3 feet away from you. I wrote the jingle For hawthorne wipe's moist towelettes. I would have done your song for free. Smooth move, metamucil.	|Pierce Annie
troy could do the school song. Troy invited rap music, And he's related to danny glover and president obama.	|Abed Group
abed, have you been racist this whole time While i'm telling everybody at church What a sweet little caramel angel you are?	|Shirley Abed
hey, man, that stuff i said this morning wasn't true. I was just messin' with you.	|Troy Abed
you were lying?	|Abed Troy
yeah, as a joke. You've never had anybody mess with you before?	|Troy Abed
yes. just kidding. no. like that? This isn't a table. Ha ha! that's funny.	|Abed
remember when we used to study spanish?	|Jeff Britta
pierce!	|Annie Pierce
yo.	|Pierce Annie
i talked to the dean, And he said you can write greendale's school song.	|Annie Pierce
well, that's more like it.	|Pierce Annie
you know the statue dedication is this friday. So you have to have it done by then.	|Annie Pierce
this friday? this friday?	|Pierce Annie
if that's not enough time--	|Annie Pierce
no, no, no! You really don't know much about genius, do you? Yes, i can do it by friday.	|Pierce Annie
great! There's a piano in the rehearsal space, And i'll help you out however i can. You're gonna do an awesome job!	|Annie Pierce
i know!	|Pierce Annie
so...this is the last chance For the cheater to be an adult and face la musica... Or everyone fails.	|Chang All
no!	|Annie Chang
you got ten seconds... Starting now. no! I've never... gotten a zero before.	|Annie All
i did it.	|Britta Chang
Britta!	|Shirley Britta
well, you really took your sweet time with that one, baby.	|Chang Britta
how dare you terrorize a class by threatening their grades. It's not that easy to get human beings to turn on each other.	|Britta Chang
turn on her!	|Chang All
ow! real mature!	|Britta All
that's right. we are mature! Too mature to sit in a class With a cheating, lying poop-face!	|Chang Britta
Okay. time to learn some formal greetings.	|Chang All
so... Wow.	|Jeff Britta
yeah, i bet you're enjoying this.	|Britta Jeff
yeah, well, when we first met, Like you were up here and i was here, and now... Oh, wait, i gave a quarter to a dirty bum today.	|Jeff Britta
what do you think they're gonna do to me?	|Britta Jeff
well, we're not gonna buy you an ice cream. Hi. dean pelton. What an entrance i got to make there. You would be Britta perry. I just spoke with senor chang, And i'm afraid greendale takes this kinda thing Very seriously.	|Dean Britta
much like a university would!	|Dean All
Your case will be reviewed By a disciplinary tribunal tomorrow In borchart hall. You could be facing expulsion.	|Dean Britta
isn't borchart hall the pool?	|Jeff Dean
there is an olympic-sized pool there, yes,	|Dean Jeff
But we will be next to it, using its $6,000 judge's table!	|Dean All
uh, is she allowed to have counsel? I mean, i may not be a practicing lawyer anymore, But relative to this place, i'm alan dershowitz.	|Jeff Dean
oh, okay, ouch, and yes. If you'd like, you may represent her. Dean you later.	|Dean Jeff
i'm not gonna sit while some hokey tribunal Gets its jollies judging me.	|Britta Jeff
hey, if you show up with me, follow my lead, And deny everything, you'll walk. That's the winger guarantee.	|Jeff Britta
i get it. You think you're gonna save my bacon Using your lawyer powers And send me into fits of grateful arousal.	|Britta Jeff
i can neither confirm nor deny that. See how good i am?	|Jeff Britta
hey, troy. did you hear? All dogs are blue now. Every single dog in the world is blue. I'm just messing with you.	|Abed Troy
yeah, i know, but let me explain to you A few things about how this works. Uh, first of all, i cannot be got, Because i am not gullible like you. Secondly, you are not good at this, Because you are not believable in your face, okay? Your face? it's bad.	|Troy Abed
okay.	|Abed Troy
um, also... You gotta ride the line between believable and-- what are you writing in?	|Troy Abed
it's a notepad.	|Abed Troy
yeah, but what are-- what language?	|Troy Abed
it's probably arabic.	|Abed Troy
all right, i am convening this disciplinary tribunal At our state-of-the-art judge's table, Which has its own built-in sound system, So take that yale. Our judges include myself, uh, dean craig pelton.	|Dean All
professor ian duncan.	|Duncan All
professor ben chang.	|Chang All
uh, no, you're a teacher. you're not a professor.	|Duncan Chang
maybe because i don't look like ron weasley.	|Chang Duncan
that's the difference. That's the qualifying factor. gentlemen, point of order.	|Duncan Chang
How can senor chang be one of the judges? He's the one accusing my client.	|Jeff Duncan Dean Chang
yeah, well, you got prince charles over here, Who's your drinking buddy.	|Chang Jeff Duncan
oh, got me.	|Duncan Chang
well, it sounds like there are two biases, One on each side, and i go both ways. Oh, let's strike that.	|Dean Jeff
Lashonda, can we please strike that?	|Dean Extra
I am impartial, so it should all work out. Okay. let's begin.	|Dean Jeff
fine. the tribunal calls teacher chang.	|Duncan Chang
okay, just keep it up frost/nixon.	|Chang Duncan
i was planning on doing that. Cleared my whole day. Uh, mr. chang, could you remind us Of the events of yesterday?	|Duncan Chang
with great pleasure. it was a tuesday, Uh, crack of dawn, 5:58 a.m. I got up, i took my morning deuce, I made a breakfast consisting of..	|Chang All
* green-dale * * green-dale * * slop *  Mm, nah. * green * * gree--green * * greendale isn't a slop pail *	|Pierce
hi, almost done.	|Pierce Annie
oh, good.	|Annie Pierce
you can tell the dean i'll have a song That'll make the devil poop god's pants.	|Pierce Annie
that's exciting. Mind if i hear what you got so far?	|Annie Pierce
well, uh, yeah, sure. I, uh--i'll probably open with something like this. uh... You know, a note like that. And end with a note like that. Uh, the words, i can't tell you. You know, the rest is really a surprise.	|Pierce Annie
i'm just a little worried. I keep hearing the same two notes, And your sheet music Looks like a chinese takeout menu.	|Annie Pierce
a musician sees music in everything, annie. I mean, it could be... * moo shoo pork * * squab with lettuce * * You see? i mean, it just comes out. You know what? you really shouldn't be here right now.	|Pierce Annie
what?	|Annie Pierce
you are inside a throbbing, cosmic womb Of creativity, And when this baby starts kicking, I cannot be responsible for your sanity. i know it sounds funny, But let me play you out, okay? Playing you out now, this song. You know, like on stage? playing you out, okay? Thanks for coming. bye-bye.	|Pierce Annie
and then she yelled, "screw you," Or, "screw education," or something like that, And then she stormed out of the room In her high-heel boots like it was tampon time... If you know what i mean.	|Chang All
objection. i don't know what he means.	|Jeff All
please don't encourage him, winger. Do you have any more questions?	|Duncan Jeff
the defense calls Britta perry.	|Jeff All
now, are those the high-heel boots He was talking about?	|Dean Britta
yes.	|Britta Dean
are they comfortable?	|Dean Britta
yeah.	|Britta Dean
i'm just curious. they're cute.	|Dean Britta
thank you.	|Britta Dean
miss perry... Did you make that crib sheet?	|Jeff Britta
no.	|Britta Jeff
she confessed!	|Chang Jeff
she confessed to protect her classmates, Because you were threatening to flunk everyone!	|Jeff Chang
you did what?	|Duncan Chang
oh, shut your pompous vortex of overlapping fangs!	|Chang Duncan
hey, british dentistry is not on trial.	|Duncan Chang
dean pelton, i move this case Be thrown out of... The pool area!	|Jeff Dean
well, it certainly--	|Dean All
Well, it certainly sounds to me That this young lady's only crime Is being a hero and wanting to be taller. This tribunal is adjourned.	|Dean All
wait! i cheated!	|Britta All
and we're back.	|Dean All
objection. my client did not cheat.	|Jeff All
yes, i did.	|Britta All
yes, she did... But why? That's the real question, isn't it? The world wasn't the only thing that changed On september 11th.	|Jeff All
Jeff, come on.	|Britta Jeff
five-minute recess?	|Jeff All
no, no. there's nothing In the bylaws about recesses, all right? The wheels of justice here don't stop Just because you--aah! Time out! time out! Save the table! save the table!	|Dean All
Beginning transmission. The primary purpose seems to be male bonding, And the attitude during conveyance Of the random deceit is apparently of great importance. The humanoid is approximately 5'10" in height.	|Abed
what are you doing?	|Troy Abed
oh, hey. troy. I didn't see you. Um, how long were you standing there?	|Abed Troy
you trying to mess with me?	|Troy Abed
yes, that's what i was doing. You got me. I was just messing with you, but i guess i blew it again.	|Abed Troy
yeah. You did.	|Troy Abed
man, don't turn your back on me.	|Chang Duncan
it is on like donkey kong! Have you got a problem with me?	|Duncan Chang
i don't like the fact that you're walking around here Like you're better than me in front of my students.	|Chang Duncan
i'm sorry. do you mind if we have this conversation In a room with less balls?	|Duncan Chang
You're very confident, i'll say that.	|Duncan Extra
but you shouldn't be.	|Chang Extra
what are you doing out there?	|Jeff Britta
you know i have a problem with dishonesty.	|Britta Jeff
you're on trial for cheating! Fa--look, we'll be fine. I just have to go back out there And make the case that you're a good person--	|Jeff Britta
you don't know that. You're just doing all of this 'cause you want to sleep with me I mean, you said it yourself. You don't even want to be my friend.	|Britta Jeff
wait a minute. Wait, is that what you thought i meant? Britta, look at me. Look at me!	|Jeff Britta
i am.	|Britta Jeff
no, look how handsome my face is. If all i wanted was sex, I could get it from plenty of women Without having to go through all this crap. I'm here because i like you, And i--i'd be psyched to be your friend. I just didn't want to take sex off the table Without doing my due diligence.	|Jeff Britta
i actually believe you.	|Britta Jeff
well, why wouldn't you?	|Jeff Britta
i don't know. I guess...same reason that i cheated. I...just have more experience being worthless. I think i left that crib sheet on the floor Because i wanted to get caught. I'm so used to screwing everything up I just wanted to get it over with.	|Britta Jeff
wait. i think we have our defense.	|Jeff Britta
Gentlemen... My client is insane.	|Jeff All
what?	|Britta Jeff
gentlemen, i'm sure you suspected... That ms. perry was pretty odd before the recess. But if you could've heard all the stuff She just told me in the shower, You would realize she is all the way out Of her entire damn mind. She doesn't want to succeed Because she doesn't think she can. So she goes out of her way to fail. That's crazy! But... Do we really want to make it a crime To be crazy at greendale? I mean, look at us. I mean, you two are arguing about status at a college That correspondence schools make fun of. Dean, you want so bad for this place to be ivy league That you are putting us at risk of electrocution. Everyone on this campus is nuts.	|Jeff All
not me!	|Leonard Jeff
oh, come on, leonard. If you're gonna argue with me, put on a bathing suit.	|Jeff Leonard
busted.	|Leonard Jeff
if you want to rehabilitate your fellow inmate, you need to sentence her to staying here with us. Because if crazy people can't be at greendale, Where are we supposed to go?	|Jeff All
Wow, well, under the circumstances I'll recommend that the accused Be fully exonerated. On the condition that she receives Psychological counseling on a weekly basis From a trained mental health professional. Thinking maybe fridays, nine-ish, something like that.	|Duncan All
All in favor say "aye."	|Duncan Dean Chang
aye.	|Dean Duncan
aye.	|Chang Duncan
yes!	|Jeff
wait, what?	|Britta Duncan
that just happened.	|Duncan Britta
greetings, abed.	|AbedAlien Abed
greetings, commander.	|Abed AbedAlien
t-t-tell me about the one they call troy.	|AbedAlien Abed
well, he is rather arrogant And has no mercy for weaker beings.	|Abed AbedAlien
stop. stop doing this right now.	|Troy Abed
whoa, whoa, whoa. I'm not an alien.	|Abed Troy
i never thought you were. But this is insane, okay? Those are credible alien hand movements. You invented a whole language. I'm pretty sure you rented a green screen.	|Troy Abed
yeah.	|Abed Troy
it would be less creepy If you were actually an alien.	|Troy Abed
this is what friends do.	|Abed Troy
no. From now on, abed, friends don't mess with each other. okay?	|Troy Abed
cool.	|Abed Troy
cool?	|Troy Abed
cool. bam bam!	|Abed Troy
garrett, it's over. he knows.	|Abed Garrett
we will stick things in his butt.	|AbedAlien Abed
you're getting a little sloppy.	|Troy Abed
we went over-budget.	|Abed Troy
mm.	|Troy Abed
I've got it. * greendale, greendale little star-- * Oh!	|Pierce
I'm a fraud, annie.	|Pierce Annie
I'm no more of a songwriter than you or billy joel. but what about the hawthorne wipes jingle?	|Annie Pierce
oh, yeah, yeah, sure, the haw-- You want to hear it? here. * you'll be wiping off that ketchup * * with our wipes, hawthorne wipes! * * you'll be wiping off that mustard * * with our wipes at the picnic! *	|Pierce Annie
that's she'll be coming around the mountain.	|Annie Pierce
i know! i steal everything. You backed the wrong horse. i got nothing.	|Pierce Annie
pierce, you're musical. you're creative. You can do this. i believe in you.	|Annie Pierce
well, you shouldn't. i quit.	|Pierce Annie
you listen up, pierce! I'm gonna tell you what my mother told me When i wanted to quit cheerleading. You're not very pretty, you have no boobs, And you can't do a basket toss to save your life, But you made a commitment. So pick up your pompoms, pierce, Stuff your bra, and get ready for the team bus To forget you at a taco bell, because life is tough. But we soldier on, And that's just the way it goes. gonna play myself out.	|Annie Pierce
the way it goes. That's it.	|Pierce Annie
One, two, luis guzman! oh! oh, oh! You know, greendale may never be harvard	|Dean All
just don't talk to me for a while.	|Britta Jeff
no problem. just glad you're here.	|Jeff Britta
i'd like to introduce our student, pierce hawthorne, Who's written greendale its own school song.	|Dean All
Pierce, okay.	|Dean Pierce
thank you, dean, thank you.	|Pierce Dean
This song goes out to annie.	|Pierce All
oh.	|Annie
for believing in me. * standing in the bookstore line * * waiting for the bell to chime * * so you can go to class * * dancing in your underwear * * taking air conditioner repair *	|Pierce All
is this bruce hornsby?	|Abed Jeff
yep.	|Jeff Abed
does he know he stole it?	|Abed Jeff
i don't think so. let him enjoy it.	|Jeff Abed
can we get sued?	|Abed Jeff
not sure.	|Jeff Abed
* greendale's the way it goes *	|Pierce All
yeah, they got us.	|Jeff Abed
* some things are still the same * * slop pails and pantyhose * * oh, annie believes in me *	|Pierce All

a small fading remnant of a star.	|Annie Troy
a white dwarf.	|Troy Annie
that's right!	|Annie Troy
i used a memory technique. dwarves hate being called midgets, and midgets are small.	|Troy Annie
and... what does a star turn into after it collapses?	|Annie Troy
a movie of the week.	|Jeff Troy
black hole.	|Troy Annie
right! troy! you could be an astronomer.	|Annie Troy
as far as i'm concerned, there's only one black hole worth studying. it's called sagittarius a, it's located in the center of our galaxy, and it has the density of 40 suns. just like my weiner.	|Pierce Group
ha ha. you said weiner. that's funny.	|Troy Pierce
pierce and troy didn't get along at first, but now they're bonding through mutual adolescence.	|Abed Group
shut up, boo-boo head.	|Pierce Abed
will you shut up, fart head?	|Troy Abed
hi, everybody. well, look at this group having some kind of meeting and being so diverse. there is just--boy! there is just one of every kind of you, isn't there?	|Dean Group
well, we are missing a pipsqueak, but we don't want one, so beat it.	|Pierce Dean
um, pierce, that's the dean.	|Britta Pierce
are you kidding?	|Pierce Britta
mm-mm.	|Britta Pierce
sorry. just my luck.	|Pierce Dean
it's all right. don't let me interrupt. sometimes i just roll around campus like a little football. i can't believe this. here i am in a random conversation about football, and i'm talking to troy barnes, star quarterback from riverside high...whoa.	|Dean Group
troy, did you know that greendale has a football team?	|Dean Troy
did you know they had a football?	|Jeff Troy
ha. that's very funny.	|Dean Jeff
troy, i was so sorry to hear about your injury. but now that you have recovered, we would love for you to play for the human beings.	|Dean Troy
the team's name is the human beings?	|Shirley Dean
yeah. my idea. it was the greendale grizzlies, but i thought that, um... well, a lot of these students have been called animals their whole lives. unfortunately, i don't know what to do about the mascot.	|Dean Shirley
oh, i can help you with that, your honor. i have a wealth of experience in image management, icon development, and y2k preparedness.	|Pierce Dean
well, aren't you found money	|Dean Pierce
troy, all of your friends are lining up to turn greendale around. how about you?	|Dean Troy
troy isn't interested in football anymore. getting injured in that keg stand was the best thing that ever happened to him.	|Annie Dean
whoa! yoko ono much?	|Dean Annie
bros before hoes, troy.	|Dean Troy
listen, man. no offense, but i was the best, and i finished on top. i wouldn't play for this school with a 10-foot pole.	|Troy Dean
dean, i'm sure troy will sign up for football if and when some accident damages the part of his brain that feels pride. until then, would you excuse us?	|Jeff Dean
all right, well, uh... if you change your mind, the field is always open. oh, figuratively speaking. you know, wednesdays and sundays it's used as parking overflow for the mega-church. okay.	|Dean Troy
now let's meet the minimum requirements for a language credit, shall we?	|Jeff Group
yes, but i need to go to the bathroom first.	|Shirley Group
uh, britta?	|Shirley Britta
oh, no, i don't have to go.	|Britta Shirley
i'll go with you.	|Annie Shirley
what? she's offended?	|Britta Jeff
girls go in groups. did you learn nothing from stand-up comedy in the '90s?	|Jeff Britta
i'm familiar with the concept. i'm just-- fine. if it's important to shirley, i'll go with her next time. i'm willing to try some more mainstream feminine stuff.	|Britta Jeff
well, then you should know that nothing says "i'm a woman" like doing it with me.	|Jeff Britta
nothing says, "i'm a pig" like you.	|Britta Jeff
will they or won't they? sexual tension.	|Abed Group
abed, it makes the group uncomfortable when you talk about us like we're characters in a show you're watching.	|Jeff Abed
well, that's sort of my gimmick. but we did lean on that pretty hard last week. i can lay low for an episode.	|Abed Jeff
you sure you made the right call on the football team, troy? it looks like they won something once. "most valued customer. henderson trophy cases."	|Jeff Troy
so we should still study a little more astronomy later, right? maybe over some milky ways or some mars bars.	|Annie Troy
or pancakes!	|Troy Annie
"i'm jeff. and i'm a student at greendale." that's not good.	|Jeff
wood undergoes rapid oxidation because it reacts spontaneously to-- okay, guys, seriously, we've talked about this, okay? you have got to turn off your cell-- that's mine. my bad.	|Extra All
i'm going to the bathroom. would you like to come with me?	|Britta Shirley
well, yes, yes, i would. oh, that's nice!	|Shirley Britta
okay, what's it called? antoni--an--hold on. does anyone have a pen? pen?	|Extra Extra
no one has a pen. why would you not bring a pen to class? idiot.	|Extra All
no, you're not an idiot.	|Extra Extra
i had my blinker on about five minutes, and this no-good, clearly bald but trying to hide it with a bandana loser swooped right in. i couldn't believe it.	|Shirley Britta
maybe he didn't see you.	|Britta Shirley
he saw me!	|Shirley Britta
maybe he had his blinker on too.	|Britta Shirley
maybe. so you... got any family, britta?	|Shirley Britta
yeah, whatever.	|Britta Shirley
think my mom might visit this weekend. she and i are gonna get makeovers at that spa--	|Shirley Britta
makeovers. they sure have us programmed, right? i am a female pleasure unit. i require a new coat of paint.	|Britta Shirley
just something i thought might be fun.	|Shirley Britta
here's something i think might be fun. let's find out the number of makeup companies that are owned by women. i'll save you the trouble. it's zero. but of course you're saying, "britta, aren't you a hypocrite? "you're plastered with glitter and goo from head to toe, just like the rest of us." well, i also pay income tax and pull over for cops, but that doesn't mean i support--	|Britta Shirley
thanks for offering to help design the new mascot. i, uh, have been a little stumped.	|Dean Pierce
that's no problem. by the way, i took the liberty of thumbnailing a human being prototype which i modeled after da vinci's vitruvian man. the penis is a little small, i think.	|Pierce Dean
oh, i think it's-- oh. okay. it...looks a lot like you. um, here's the thing. if we are the human beings, you know, and we have a mascot that's just a white guy, what message are we sending? our symbol needs to reflect the diversity of our school and our species.	|Dean Pierce
so...black?	|Pierce Dean
no. no, because we're not the greendale blacks, mr. hawthorne, or the greendale asians or any other creed. we are the greendale human beings.	|Dean Pierce
sorry to disturb you guys... who are clearly looking at a naked drawing of pierce doing jumping jacks.	|Jeff Pierce Dean
dean, a quick download, please?	|Jeff Dean
uh, absolutely.	|Dean Jeff
excuse me.	|Dean Pierce
okay. fill me in later.	|Pierce Dean
ah. whoa-oh. i'll go with a pencil.	|Pierce
first of all...	|Jeff Dean
mm-hmm.	|Dean Jeff
i'm flattered.	|Jeff Dean
oh, well. you're a very photogenic man. is that real bed head, or do you put something in there? can i? oh, it's crispy.	|Dean Jeff
i was thinking about the four disembodied heads, and i thought, where's the heart? where's the soul? where's the different poster design?	|Jeff Dean
you know, i did think those were less than personable, which is why i went with the full bodies in these mailers we have going out.	|Dean Jeff
mailers? i didn't give permission for this.	|Jeff Dean
jeffrey, did you not read the release agreement on the back of your registration form? i'm starting to see why someone used to be a lawyer. ha ha! up top!	|Dean Jeff
if someone from the outside were to find-- okay, if someone from the outside were to find out that i am a student at a community college, that could have a negative impact on my future career.	|Jeff Dean
oh. goodness. look what we have stumbled onto-- an opportunity to help each other out. i suppose i wouldn't need this promotional campaign if i could announce to the press that troy barnes is playing football here.	|Dean Jeff
i think he's been pretty clear about declining that offer.	|Jeff Dean
i think if you said, "jump," he'd say, "how high?" if you said, "stop," he'd say, "hammertime." you starting to get what i mean?	|Dean Jeff
no. i need another example.	|Jeff Dean
you know, i didn't... realize before, but we should send those out to local businesses. hmm? law firms. lawyer... companies? legal... gatherings?	|Dean Jeff
are you trying to blackmail me?	|Jeff Dean
i think so.	|Dean Jeff
gentlemen... i present to you the greendale human being.	|Pierce Jeff Dean
that's a falcon with a gun. now it's a falcon with an erection.	|Jeff Pierce
Hi Abed		|Shirley Abed
hi	|Britta Abed
He's just laying low	|Britta Troy Annie
Wait, are you going to the bathroom?	|Britta Shirley
uh, yes	|Shirley Britta
I'll go with you	|Britta Shirley
blue bird day to shred some pow. you know what? I'm good	|Shirley Britta
She probably just... you know... had to go number two	|Britta Annie Troy
Ok, what's the closest planet to Earth?	|Annie Troy
Planet Hollywood	|Troy Annie
That's not the right answer, but it shows how fun the astronomy can be!	|Annie Troy
Hey Troy, can I talk to you for a second?	|Jeff Troy
We are studying, so Troy is busy	|Annie Jeff
Well the galaxy is not going anywhere, I'll bring him back	|Jeff Annie
Do you ever miss being a quarterback, Troy?	|Jeff Troy
I miss being the best at something, miss having a coach I miss knowing what to think	|Troy Jeff
You still know what to think, Troy	|Jeff Troy
Oh good	|Troy Jeff
For instance, after Dean talked about you playing football, you and I were thinking the same thing	|Jeff Troy
That dude looks like Moby	|Troy Jeff
You were thinking, what if Troy did play for Greendale You'd be surprised how many of your favorite football players got started at community college	|Jeff Troy
Oh really? Name one	|Troy Jeff
Who's your favorite player?	|Jeff Troy
Me. Woah	|Troy Jeff
Maybe you and I should checkout the Greendale Thunderdome	|Jeff Troy
the dome arrives later. it comes with thunder. let me tell you a little secret about me, troy. every day on my way to school, i drive through downtown past the courthouse just to get a glimpse of the world that i once ruled. and i just wanna jump out of my car, run up the steps and... exploit the legal system for profit. but i can't. i'm locked out of my old kingdom. you're not. you see what i'm saying?	|Jeff Troy
you're saying i could be a lawyer.	|Troy Jeff
i'm saying you're a football player! it's in your blood!	|Jeff Troy
that's racist!	|Troy Jeff
your soul.	|Jeff Troy
that's racist.	|Troy Jeff
your eyes?	|Jeff Troy
that's gay?	|Troy Jeff
that's homophobic.	|Jeff Troy
that's black.	|Troy Jeff
that's racist!	|Jeff Troy
damn.	|Troy Jeff
when you played, you were a god. now you're not playing, and you're not. i'd tell you to do the math, but math isn't important. the only thing that's important is this.	|Jeff Troy
yeah, but annie said--	|Troy Jeff
annie said that benjamin button was compelling. look, she's a smart girl, but sometimes she's just wrong.	|Jeff Troy
85--go long!	|Jeff Extra
it's like a drug, isn't it? feel it, troy. throw it! the scoreboard lights up. there will be a scoreboard there. it's complete!	|Jeff Troy
nice catch!	|Jeff Extra
the girls, the glory, the scouts, the career! it starts when you join this team.	|Jeff Troy
is that linebacker a pregnant woman?	|Troy Jeff
look, you can meet them later. but this decision has to be yours, t-bone. and this decision has to be yes.	|Jeff Troy
how did you know my nickname's t-bone?	|Troy Jeff
because you're a football player, and your name begins with "t." your name begins with "t."	|Jeff Troy
britta?	|Shirley Britta
oh. are you finished? i mean, i have to go, but apparently, i failed yesterday's tryouts for the position of bathroom companion.	|Britta Shirley
oh, britta, i wasn't trying to hurt your feelings.	|Shirley Britta
you didn't hurt my feelings, shirley. i don't need to go to the bathroom with other people. i was just trying to throw you a bone because i like you.	|Britta SHirley
oh. you can keep that bone. listening to a story about a stranger pissing me off and taking the stranger's side? and then you can't talk about your own business, but you insinuate my mama's a robot because she and i want makeovers. that is the ladies' room, britta, a place where ladies go to share, listen, support each other and... discreetly eliminate waste. and i like you too. even like that you're a little hard. but if you can't learn to be soft in there, you need to pee alone.	|Shirley Britta
i've peed alone my whole life. women have always hated me. i don't even know how it started. maybe it was when i got boobs before everyb--	|Britta Shirley
shh, shh, shh. not out here. in there.	|Shirley Britta
whoo! ha ha! troy, troy, the wonder boy! you dropped your books, poindexter. yeah!	|Troy Extra
troy, i've been waiting for an hour.	|Annie Troy
it's all right, i'm worth it. * hip, hop, body don't stop *	|Troy Annie
troy. why are you doing a politically conservative high school shamefully outdated fight rap? have you been playing football?	|Annie Troy
threw the skin around a couple of times. still got it. eh...eh...eh...eh... doosh!	|Troy Annie
but you knew we had an astronomy test tomorrow.	|Annie Troy
class blows. what i need to know about the universe is that i'm at the center of it.	|Troy Annie
troy! stop! don't become this person again. this isn't the real you. this is the arrogant jock that totally ignored the only people that truly liked him for non-superficial reasons but weren't allowed to say anything because their parents are bigots! football is bad for you, troy.	|Annie Troy
jeff said you'd say that.	|Troy Annie
jeff...what now?	|Annie Troy
troy! troy, troy, troy. that's my name.	|Troy
i think if we add in a little bit of phylicia rashad we'll be in better shape.	|Pierce Dean
yeah, you're right. that beige is a little light.	|Dean Pierce
wow.	|Jeff Dean Pierce
yeah. yeah. we are developing the perfect mascot. no stereotypical identifiers from any race or gender.	|Dean Jeff
see, jeff, this is a chart of the features we're staying away from-- pan-asian eye folds, irish chins, women's breasts.	|Pierce Jeff
is that seal?	|Jeff Dean Pierce
that is our human color wheel. it goes from seal to seal's teeth. what do you think?	|Dean Jeff
i think not being racist is the new racism.	|Jeff Dean
whoa, whoa, whoa-- what happened to the prototype?	|Dean Pierce
ooh! i left the nose in the kiln.	|Pierce Dean
so...troy is gonna play football.	|Jeff Dean
yes!	|Dean Jeff
which means i'll be getting rid of these.	|Jeff Dean
no. i won't mail these out, but they are staying with me until the press announces that troy is a part of the team. and i want him at that pep rally tonight. reporters are gonna be there. we're gonna unveil the new mascot. and things are finally going to start turning around. oh, and...my ex-therapist is gonna think twice before he makes fun of my job!	|Dean Jeff
here it is. still hot.	|Pierce Dean
ooh. ow.	|Dean Pierce
oh, dean, i'm gonna get some more coffee. you want anything?	|Pierce Dean
oh, yeah, a desmond tutu with just enough cream to make it a lou diamond phillips.	|Dean Pierce
la bamba. got it.	|Pierce Dean
i've been following you. how much did the dean pay you to make troy play football?	|Annie jeff
i'm not having a conversation with someone who emerges from a bush.	|Jeff Annie
because i'm right?	|Annie Jeff
no. because i'm not in a commercial for breakfast cereal. look...the dean has pictures of me, okay? horrible pictures of me... attending his school.	|Jeff Annie
and for that you'd convince troy to flush his life down football's toilet again? britta's right, you are the most selfish person alive! and all that is gonna end right now. because i'm telling him what kind of friend you really are.	|Annie Jeff
maybe you should tell him you're hopelessly in love with him. high school must have been tough, huh? waiting for a superstar to notice you. but here...here... he's all alone, and he needs so much help! did you enroll in all of his classes, or were you worried that might freak him out? the important thing is that you are there for him. the important thing is that you are the only one there for him. and you don't really care what he wants... just as long as you don't have to share him with the rest of the world. because, really, you are just as selfish as i am. you're just not as good at it yet.	|Jeff Annie
you're right. i could never be as good as you. probably because i actually care.	|Annie Jeff
profound, but technically meaningless. and don't bother trying that thing that women do where they walk away and make the guy feel like crap, because it won't happen! yeah!	|Jeff Annie
damn it.	|Jeff
shirley, will you please come to the bathroom with me?	|Annie Shirley
where's shirley?	|Annie Britta
shirley's not coming. but i'm here... to listen...girl.	|Britta Annie
why do we inflict so much pain on ourselves for men?	|Annie Britta
i don't-- know...sweetie. maybe...it's because men make the world go round? kleenex?	|Britta Annie
i've been... infatuated with troy. now he's joining football. now he'll have his pick of the litter and... i'll never get to be with him!	|Annie Britta
oh, annie, screw him! there are guys out there that would kill to be with you. and if troy isn't one of them, that's him failing your standards. you got that?	|Britta Annie
you're right. i can't control him. and if i truly cared about him, i wouldn't want to. thanks for talking to me, britta. it really helped.	|Annie Britta
seriously?	|Britta Annie
yes.	|Annie Britta
who's my girl?	|Shirley Britta
'scuse me!	|Shirley Annie
i did it, i did it!	|Britta Shirley
oh, yes, you did!	|Shirley Britta
troy! troy! don't go in there, man.	|Troy Jeff
what?	|Jeff Troy
you got the most you were ever gonna get out of football in high school. a life of disillusionment and depression begins on the other side of that door.	|Jeff Troy
hey, man...is this your first pep rally or something?	|Extra Jeff
you told me football was the most important thing in the world.	|Troy Jeff
well, buckle up, troy. i was exaggerating. it's kinda my gimmick. let me tell you something--	|Jeff Troy
no, let me tell you something. you know that keg flip that cost me my scholarship?	|Troy Jeff
yeah.	|Jeff Troy
i hurt myself on purpose.	|Troy Jeff
what?	|Jeff Troy
there was a scout coming to the final game at riverside and...i couldn't take the pressure, so i took the easy way out. but when you showed me that field, i saw there was nothing to worry about here. i could just play football for the fun of it. i mean, have you seen these guys? there is nowhere to go but up.	|Troy Jeff
dude, we have feelings.	|Extra Troy
i don't know about you, but i know i ended up here because things weren't that great out there. you should try accepting where you're at, man. take a pottery class or something.	|Troy Jeff
greendale, we're number one! nancy pelosi is no fun!	|Troy All
hey.	|Jeff Annie
hey. i've decided to support troy. they deploy things in football, right? i went for rhyme over clarity.	|Annie Jeff
look, i'm, uh...i'm really sorry about before. i just think we were both wrong.	|Jeff Annie
really? because i'm an 18-year-old girl, and you made me cry in public.	|Annie Jeff
mm. okay, maybe i was a little more wrong. i should grow up and make peace with being here. i mean, it's not like greendale's gonna kill me or anything.	|Jeff Annie
holy crap!	|Jeff HumanBeing
aah!	|Annie HumanBeing
oh, sorry. hey, say hello to our ethnically neutral mascot-- the greendale human being. the costume makes it difficult for him to see.	|Pierce Jeff Annie
he can't move his mouth either. but take it from me, that's human for "hello."	|Dean Jeff Annie
let's get you into the pep rally!	|Dean HumanBeing
great idea. let's do it!	|Pierce HumanBeing
we've solved racism. what's next?	|Pierce Dean
uh, let's do something for little people. ooh! or albinos!	|Dean Pierce
little albinos.	|Pierce Dean
this has the potential to be a uniquely greendale experience. milady.	|Jeff Annie

As you know, all faculty at greendale are required to give extra credit to students who organizes academic related events during what would otherwise be known as 'free time' No student in any department has ever exercised this option, until now.	|Chang All
Tonight, in the library, I will be hosting a "dia de los muertos" party. Dia de los muertos, or day of the dead, is sometimes refered to as mexican Halloween	|Annie All
which is actually quite offensive to people familiar with mexican halloween as sexual position. At any rate, if you show up, you get extra credit. For me, I don't even get paid. See you tonight. In Espanol, Esta Noche	|Chang All
Um, most of you have responded to my e-vite, but some of you remain evasive, so...	|Annie All
Oo, count me in. This is my first college party. I got some tequila and just rented Van Wilder 2: The Rise of Taj. And look	|Shirley Annie
Shirley, you took off your wedding ring	|Britta Shirley
Yeah, my husband has been gone for 6 months so I think it's time for me to embrace being single	|Shirley Britta Annie
Message received	|Pierce Shirley
Um, still waiting to hear back from Jeff and Pierce	|Annie Jeff Pierce
Oh, I thought I shouted you the response from the phone here. Access email	|Pierce Annie
Are you not going to Annie's party?	|Britta Jeff
Oh, I have a conflict. It conflicts the enjoyment of my life	|Jeff Britta
I cannot figure out the voice command part of this thing. It's like my mother	|Pierce All
Calling Mother	|Phone Pierce
What?	|Pierce
Speaking of enjoying a life, I don't want to beat a dead horse here, but are you sure you don't see anything not platonic ever crystalizing between us?	|Jeff Britta
I'm sure	|Britta Jeff
OK, good. Because one of my professors is really hot, and I wanted to give you the first ride of defussal	|Jeff Britta
Hello, Pierce?	|PierceMom Pierce
Mom?	|Pierce PierceMom
How's school going? Are you popular?	|PierceMom Pierce
ha... I'm going through a tunnel right now. I.. ca... ha..	|Pierce PierceMom
The Bernoulli distribution is the number of successes in a sequence of independent yes-no experiments. Okay. Uh, for the Quiz Monday, brush up on chapters three and four.	|Slater All
Bernoulli's one of my favorites. Little-known fact, statistics were not his only love. He's also famous for his French sauce used on meat and poultry.	|Jeff Slater
That's Bearnaise.	|Slater Jeff
Oh, we may need to settle this at a restaurant.	|Jeff Slater
It's cute. A little aggressive, but as a busy, confident woman of authority, I'm attracted to men who take charge.	|Slater Jeff
Are you being sarcastic, or am I nailing it?	|Jeff Slater
You were nailing it, until you had to ask.	|Slater Jeff
Oh, damn it. Starting over. Hey, you in the skirt, date me.	|Jeff Slater
I'd like to, Mr. Winger. You're tall, you dress nice, and I've graded enough of your tests to know I'd never feel mentally inadequate.	|Slater Jeff
Thank you.	|Jeff Slater
Only problem, I don't date students.	|Slater Jeff
You know if you agree to go out with me...	|Jeff Slater
Oh, hey. Awkward. How small is this campus?	|Jeff Shirley Britta
Bastard.	|Shirley Jeff
It's fine. I don't care.	|Britta Shirley
It's disgusting the way men behave. Did you ever see that Katherine Heigl movie poster where Gerard Butler had that heart over his weiner? That resonated with me.	|Shirley Britta
Okay, fine. But just to repeat, I don't care what Jeff does.	|Britta Shirley
Bastard.	|Shirley Jeff
I'm barely a student. I'm older than you. I drive a Lexus. I saw "Ghost Busters" in the theater. Look, my gums are receding.	|Jeff Slater
It's uncanny how many of my buttons you're finding, but I have a personal rule about this, and I stick to it.	|Slater Jeff
Have a cup of coffee with me. I bet I can change your mind.	|Jeff Slater
Oh, I know you can. That's why you're not getting the chance.	|Slater Jeff
Ooh, whoo.	|Leonard Jeff
Are you coming to my Dias de los Muertos party?	|Annie Jeff
I'm definitely gonna try to swing by.	|Jeff Annie
Then I can mark you down as definitely being there from 7:00 sharp till upside-down Spanish question mark?	|Annie Jeff
Here's the thing...	|Jeff Annie
No, here's the thing. I am putting my foot down. You understand? I am being assertive, and I am making eye contact, and it is achieving results.	|Annie Jeff
Are you trying to get formidable with me?	|Jeff Annie
It worked on Pierce.	|Annie Jeff
Infomercials work on Pierce.	|Jeff Annie
Jeff, you're the cool guy, okay?	|Annie Jeff
If you show up, it'll be the first party I host where everyone doesn't say they need to get home in time for the news.	|Annie Jeff
This won't work. The last time you did this, I saved a vial of your tears and have been slowly building up an immunity.	|Jeff Annie
I was so unpopular in high school, the crossing guard used to lure me into traffic. This party is a second chance to be... Hip. Cool! Laidback!	|Annie Jeff
Look, I will come to your party.	|Jeff Annie
Thank you. I'm putting you down for two bags of ice and a sleeve of paper cups.	|Annie Jeff
Taking a pill?	|Abed Pierce
Yes, I am.	|Pierce Abed
Xenolovaden. My grandpa took that when he was around your age.	|Abed Pierce
Fantastic.	|Pierce Abed
But by the time grandpa got up in years, his memory wasn't great. He'd mix the wrong pills. You know how old people are?	|Abed Pierce
Heard stories about it, yeah.	|Pierce Abed
One time he started hallucinating and ran down the street with no pants on. Which in the Gaza Strip is considered a real party foul, so you should probably be careful...	|Abed Pierce
Look, I really don't need your advice, and I'm not your pantsless grandpa.	|Pierce Abed
Pantsless grandpa.	|Troy
Hola!	|Annie Extra
Scary.	|Annie Extra
Oh, cute! Cute.	|Annie Extra
Oh, Britta. You look adorable.	|Annie Britta
Thank you. I hate when women use Halloween as an excuse to dress up like sluts, you know?	|Britta Annie
Yeah.	|Annie Britta
Okay, everyone. I think we can begin. I've got everyone's personalized cookie tombstones, por tradicion, and in a few minutes, we're going to start the dance of the dead... La danza de los muertos.	|Annie All
You don't have to keep doing that!	|Chang Annie
Party on.	|Annie All
It's nice of you to be here. Sure you'd rather be out with your hot professor.	|Britta Jeff
Well, it's funny, I enrolled here as selfish loner, but you and the group have given me a crash course in friendship.	|Jeff Britta
She blew you off, huh?	|Britta Jeff
She's grading papers.	|Jeff Britta
Professor Slater? She's not grading papers. She's at the faculty party in the cafeteria.	|Chang Jeff
Oh, look, it's the eavesdropping matador.	|Jeff Chang
Are you saying my people are sneaky?	|Chang Jeff
What?	|Jeff Chang
There's a storm building on the horizon, but you and I will save the night. Chex mix, pretzels, baby carrots, predictable but appetizing.	|Abed Jeff
Hey.	|Troy Abed
Hey.	|Abed Troy
Can I ask you something I always wanted to ask the real Batman?	|Troy Abed
Yeah.	|Abed Troy
Am I good looking?	|Troy Abed
You're a very attractive young man.	|Abed Troy
I knew it.	|Troy Abed
Let's get this party started!	|Pierce All
Who are you?	|Britta Pierce
I am the Beastmaster. From the movie Beastmaster. What rock have you been living under?	|Pierce Britta
What are you going as? A gay douchebag? Just kidding.	|Pierce Jeff
Nice one. I'm not much of a costume guy.	|Jeff Pierce
I know, you're not much of a liking the ladies guy either, huh? Oop. Body blow. Is that liquor?	|Pierce Jeff
Hello. Here's your drinks, mates.	|Shirley Jeff Britta
Oh, thanks, Urkel.	|Jeff Shirley
I'm Harry Potter.	|Shirley Jeff
Really?	|Jeff Shirley
What up, Urkel?	|Chang Shirley
Hey.	|Starburns Pierce
Oh...	|Pierce
All right. What are you taking?	|Starburns Pierce
You know, the usual cool stuff. I've got 'ludes, uh, dreamers... Johnny boys.	|Pierce Starburns
Tell you what. I'll trade you one of mine for two of yours. Hmm?	|Starburns Pierce
I don't know, Starburns. I'm...	|Pierce Starburns
Oh, sorry. I thought I was dealing with the Beastmaster.	|Starburns Pierce
Hey, hey, who said you weren't? Saddle up, fruit pie.	|Pierce Starburns
I don't mind if I do, may I?	|Starburns Pierce
Here. take this. Give anyone that shows up their stupid credit.	|Chang Jeff
You going to the faculty party? Make me your plus one.	|Jeff Chang
Ah, give it up, Winger. Professor Slater doesn't date students. Or married Asians who drive Mopeds.	|Chang Jeff
Give you 20 bucks.	|Jeff Chang
I'll bring the hog around.	|Chang Jeff
Okay, it's time for the "dance of the dead". Everyone form a circle. Lights. Music.	|Annie All
Is it under genre or on a specific playlist?	|Abed Annie
Hey, uh, man? What'd you slip me? I keep grinding my teeth, and I want to kiss everybody.	|Pierce Starburns
What'd you slip me, man? My heart stopped racing, and I can't pee.	|Starburns Pierce
Now for the first dance, I'd like to invite a very special guest to the floor. Jeff Winger? Jeff? Where's Jeff?	|Annie All
Please slow down, please	|Jeff Chang
Stop crying, Winger	|Chang Jeff
Watch it!	|Jeff Chang
Is Jeff gone? You know, I'm gonna go. I don't want to miss the news.	|Starburns All
News!	|Annie
He just stepped out. He's gonna be right back.	|Britta Annie
He's going to the faculty party.	|Britta Shirley
To be with professor "short skirt"? We hate her.	|Shirley Britta
No, it's not about her, Shirley. I can't believe that Jeff would do this to Annie.	|Britta Shirley
Yes, absolutely. It's about Annie. We should go find that bitch's car and snap off her antenna.	|Shirley Britta
It's like high school all over again. Everyone's leaving.	|Annie
Not me. I could do this all night. I love you	|Pierce Annie
There you go, pretty lady.	|Jeff Slater
What are you doing here?	|Slater Jeff
Showing you my non-student side.	|Jeff Slater
I have to admit, this outfit's doing it for me. I may or may not have been deflowered by a junior rodeo champion.	|Slater Jeff
You're reminding me of my first time too.	|Jeff Slater
You lost your virginity to Robin Hood?	|Slater Jeff
No, with an attractive woman at a party. We seem destined to repeat history.	|Jeff Slater
I told you no students. It's unseemly. I go out with you, you tell your friends, it gets around the school...	|Slater Jeff
What friends? I have no friends. I hate everyone here but you.	|Jeff Slater
Hey.	|Britta Jeff
What are you doing here?	|Jeff Britta
What are you doing here? You should be over at the library with Annie... Whoa. Yippy ki yay. Thought you weren't a costume guy.	|Britta Jeff
You had to have one to get in here, Squirrel.	|Jeff Britta
Oh, so where did you get it? 'Cause I wouldn't think that any costume stores would be open this late.	|Britta Jeff
I don't know what you're getting at.	|Jeff Britta
I think the words that you're looking for are "I own a cowboy outfit." And it is tight too. Did you buy it like that? Your toy gun to my head, I'd say yes.	|Britta Jeff
Hi. Michelle Slater, PHD.	|Slater Britta
Britta Perry, GED.	|Britta Slater
Oh, are you a classmate of Jeff's?	|Slater Britta
Oh, well, when you say "classmate", It sounds like we take naps together and eat paste, but what's great about community colleges is that a lot of the students are just as mature as the teachers.	|Jeff Slater
Jeff, you must return to Annie's party. She's feeling unpopular.	|Abed Jeff
Jeff, Pierce took something, and he is tripping balls. He is touching people and dancing weird. it's like grumpy old men but not hilarious.	|Troy Jeff
Okay, uh, guys? I'm at a grownup Halloween party, all right? You're all being unseemly.	|Jeff Troy Abed Britta
Oh, no.	|Abed
How are we unseemly?	|Britta Jeff
Why is Urkel ripping the antenna off professor Slater's car?	|Dean All
That's right, professor Slim Calves. This is what you get when you steal Jeff from a good woman!	|Shirley Slater
No, Abed!	|Pierce
Is he meowing?	|Slater All
Yeah.	|Abed Slater
Enough. I want you guys out of here. Britta, I don't care about your high school soap opera.	|Jeff Britta
Abed, you're not Batman.	|Jeff Abed
Pierce. Pierce. Pierce. Stop grinding on the women's studies department. You are too old to be tripping.	|Jeff Pierce
I'm old? What do you mean old? Whose hands are these? Help me!	|Pierce Jeff
Way to go. I know I'm not Batman. You could try not being a jerk.	|Abed Jeff
She's pretty hot.	|Troy Jeff
Well, where were we, little doggie?	|Jeff Slater
Unseemly.	|Slater Jeff
Yeah. Crap.	|Jeff Slater
Shirley? Shirley!	|Britta Shirley
This is professor Robin Hood's office.	|Shirley Britta
So what are you doing?	|Britta Shirley
I'm putting this hose in her desk, and you going outside to turn the water on.	|Shirley Britta
Why?	|Britta Shirley
To teach that long-neck weave-having bank teller she can't steal another woman's man! That's why. I have a confession to make. I think some of what I just said may have more to do with my situation.	|Shirley Britta
Yeah, the long-neck, weave-having bank teller didn't feel universal.	|Britta Shirley
My ex-husband came by this morning, and he, uh, he asked for his ring back. It was his mother's, and he wants to give it to his new girlfriend.	|Shirley Britta
Shirley, that sucks.	|Britta Shirley
Don't get me wrong. Best thing ever happened to me was him leaving. I just... I always thought he'd come crawling back, and I'd get to tell him, "go to hell." He couldn't even give me that. You know what the crazy thing is, Britta?	|Shirley Britta
Everything you've done tonight?	|Britta Shirley
It's like I was too proud to admit I was hurt, so I had to pretend that you were.	|Shirley Britta
I totally get that.	|Britta Shirley
I feel better now.	|Shirley Britta
Let's go check on Annie.	|Britta Shirley
Can you believe I targeted this poor lady? Look at all these awards. I bet she's nice.	|Shirley Britta
Yeah.	|Britta Shirley
Nice and pretentious.	|Britta
Pierce? Pierce, are you okay?	|Annie Pierce
Hey, man, what's going on? You have a full-on erection. Just rela... Just relax.	|Troy Pierce
Pierce, relax. Just relax, okay? Pierce!	|Annie Pierce
You are too old to be tripping!	|Jeff Pierce
Pierce...	|Annie Pierce
You are too old to be tripping.	|Jeff Pierce
Tell me about the Beatles, Pierce. Tell me about Woodstock and Sputnik, Pierce.	|Annie Pierce
Gee, do I feel a breeze here? Because someone just struck out.	|Chang Jeff
She blew you off too, Chang.	|Jeff Chang
Is that what you had to fall back on? Look at me, bro. Look at me. I've got the body of a fifth grader, okay? If I was working with what you've got, she'd be at the comfort inn right now giving me a Mexican Halloween.	|Chang Jeff
It's this campus. It feeds on my coolness. I... I got no moves anymore.	|Jeff Chang
Moves? Everything's a game to guys like you. I know one move I bet you've never tried in your life.	|Chang Jeff
What is it?	|Jeff Chang
Please sleep with me. Please. Pretty please. I'm so lonely. I haven't slept with anyone in a very long time, and you are so good looking. Please do me the favor of having sex with me.	|Jeff Slater
Okay, stay three steps behind and promise you won't tell anybody.	|Slater Jeff
I promise. I promise.	|Jeff Slater
Everybody, stay out of the library.	|Pierce All
Pierce, it's okay. Come out of there.	|Shirley Pierce
No, I'm not ready to die!	|Pierce All
Pierce, you're not gonna die! Look at me!	|Britta Pierce
Just... Just keep walking. Don't make eye contact.	|Jeff Slater
Jeff. Jeff! Jeff. Pierce is freaking out. You're the only one that can help.	|Troy Jeff
What makes you think that?	|Jeff Troy
Is Jeff out there? He's the only one who can help.	|Pierce All
He says he's gonna kill himself, but he doesn't want us to call 911, because he doesn't want to get in trouble for taking drugs.	|Troy Jeff
I can't believe I'm doing this.	|Jeff
I, uh... I think I have to say goodnight.	|Jeff Slater
Are you, like, a court-appointed guardian for these people?	|Slater Jeff
Uh, no. Um, they're my classmates.	|Jeff Slater
Goodnight, Jeff.	|Slater Jeff
Loser!	|Chang Jeff
What in the Pink Floyd?	|Jeff
I'm gonna crush myself to death with desks and tables, Jeff!	|Pierce Jeff
Is that a death befitting a Beastmaster?	|Jeff Pierce
I never saw Beastmaster. I just wanted to be cool.	|Pierce Jeff
I'm coming in there, Pierce.	|Jeff Pierce
Those floating Mexican skeletons were right. My life is over.	|Pierce Jeff
Well, when we go to floating skeletons with our problems, we get what we pay for, don't we?	|Jeff Pierce
I'm old, Jeff.	|Pierce Jeff
Pierce, I don't know how you spent the first 60 years, but I know in the last two months you've probably doubled the national average for amount of life lived per lifetime.	|Jeff Pierce
well, I do have a young, African-American friend.	|Pierce Jeff
Yeah. And, more importantly, you're dressed like a gladiator in a desk fort that you built during a bad trip. If life is just a series of ridiculous attempts to be alive, you're a hero to everything that's ever lived.	|Jeff Pierce
Yeah?	|Pierce Jeff
Yeah.	|Jeff Pierce
Yeah!	|Pierce Jeff
Batman?	|Jeff Abed
Yeah?	|Abed Jeff
Are you staying for the party?	|Jeff Abed
If I stay, there can be no party.	|Abed Jeff
I must be out there in the night, staying vigilant. Wherever a party needs to be saved, I'm there. Wherever there are masks, wherever there's tomfoolery and joy, I'm there. But sometimes I'm not, 'cause I'm out in the night, staying vigilant, watching, lurking, running, jumping, hurtling, sleeping... No, I can't sleep. You sleep. I'm awake. I don't sleep. I don't blink. Am I a bird? No. I'm a bat. I am Batman. Or am I? Yes, I am Batman. Happy Halloween.	|Abed
I'm Batman.	|Troy Abed
You sound like cookie monster.	|Abed Troy
I'm Batman.	|Troy Abed
That's Batman.	|Abed Troy
Candy corn looks like tiny traffic cones.	|Troy Abed
Yeah, it sure does.	|Abed Troy
At, like, a candy traffic school. Like, a little gingerbread man at the wheel, and he's drunk.	|Troy Abed
Look out.	|Abed Troy
You'd be driving, But you keep wanting to eat yourself.	|Troy Abed
All day.	|Abed Troy
That's one of my biggest fears.	|Troy Abed
What is?	|Abed Troy
If I ever, like, woke up as a donut.	|Troy Abed
You would eat yourself?	|Abed Troy
I wouldn't even question it.	|Troy Abed
That'd be tasty.	|Abed Troy
It's cool to know other people think about this stuff too.	|Troy Abed
Yeah.	|Abed Troy

Say there are two friends and they're in the same class and one wants to ask the other one out on a date. Like a grown-up date, but within biking distance of his parents' house.	|Troy Annie
They could do something on campus. Tomorrow there's a picnic with live music on the East lawn. They're calling it "A night under the stars".	|Annie Troy
Cool. I bet Randi would love that type of thing.	|Troy Annie
Randi? I thought...	|Annie Troy
You thought... Can't believe I misled you like that. Listen... Randi can be the name of a guy or a girl. And in this case, it is definitely a girl. Thanks for your help.	|Troy Annie
You're welcome. And I hate you. And I want to have your children.	|Annie Troy
Damn, I picked the wrong couple to follow out of class this morning. Jeff and Britta are dead air.	|Shirley
Are you okay? It looks like you have actual bed head this morning.	|Britta Jeff
In fashion, I'm what's known as a tastemaker.	|Jeff Britta
And you missed an entire side of your face shaving.	|Britta Jeff
And next month, so will Gwen Stefani. Here comes Vaughn. Bye.	|Jeff Britta
Crap.	|Britta Jeff
Vaughn? The guy with the tiny nipples you did it with.	|Pierce Britta
Hi, Vaughn. Can we talk sometime? I'm sorry about how things ended.	|Britta Vaughn
I'm sorry I can't accept your apology 'cause you're toxic, Britta. You're like the exact opposite of an antioxidant. I got band practice. Lates.	|Vaughn Britta
Can't we still be friends? And isn't the word "later" already short enough?	|Britta Vaughn
Let me talk to him for you. Man-to-man is better. We won't think about our chubby thighs or whether or not we can have babies.	|Pierce Britta
Don't talk to Vaughn.	|Britta Pierce
Your hormones are clouding your...	|Pierce Britta
Don't talk to Vaughn.	|Britta Pierce
That is "girl" for "talk to Vaughn".	|Pierce
You sure you don't want a piece of that?	|Shirley Britta
What is he doing?	|Britta Shirley
I know exactly what he's doing. My ex-husband spent four weeks doing that after his "innocent mistake" of calling me Valerie. That boy's living in his car.	|Shirley Britta
I lived in my car for a stretch in the '70s. Nothing like bedding a woman on the vinyl backseat of a Skylark. Of course, we didn't have the same safety standards back then so... No condoms. I tell you, before aids, sex was like shaking hands.	|Pierce Group
Hence aids.	|Abed Pierce
Brittles, I forgot to tell you, I went and talked to Vaughn. The bad news is I could not patch up things between you. You really did a number on him. Good news is I'm the new keyboardist in his band.	|Pierce Britta
So I asked you not to talk to him and you completely ignored me.	|Britta Pierce
You're missing the headline. I'm in a rock band!	|Pierce Britta
I'd like to be there when the band finds out.	|Jeff Pierce
Hi Jeff. We were just talking about how in today's economy...	|Britta Jeff
Living in your car. You are living in your car. I'm sorry, I'm not good at being coy.	|Shirley Jeff
I'm not living in my car. I'm just sleeping in it for a couple of days while I work at some problems with my condo. It's a very temporary issue. I've got to pay some meaningless fees and then they'll put my locks back on the door and that'll be that.	|Jeff Shirley Britta
How you'll get the money?	|Britta Jeff
Believe me, kitten, Winger's got moves.	|Jeff Britta
Do you need a place to stay?	|Shirley Jeff
I'd offer but my dad's kind of racist.	|Jeff Troy
Stay with me. My room has a bunk bed, which is a misnomer because it's the real deal.	|Abed Jeff
The next person that offers me charity or pity will be mentioned by name in my suicide note.	|Jeff Group
Annie. Annie. Thanks for your advice about "a night under the stars".	|Troy Annie
Of course. Anytime. Ever.	|Annie Troy
I got to figure out what to bring to the picnic. This is my first college girl so I really want to impress her. Would you mind helping me shop for this stuff?	|Troy Annie
I'd love to.	|Annie Troy
Really? Thanks. Later.	|Troy Annie
Wanna see my place?	|Britta Jeff
I can see it. Two girls are making out on the hood.	|Jeff Britta
No, my real place. The condo board's trying to bluff me by listing my place as available. Look at those faucets. Handcrafted in Italy. 100% expensive.	|Jeff Britta
Those faucets are beautiful. You know what they would go great with: a home, which you no longer have. You need to move on with your life.	|Britta Jeff
Yeah. Move on with my life. "Shmove shmon shmith shmy shmife. " This condo is all that's left of me. Every part of it is a part of who I am.	|Jeff Britta
Is that a bidet?	|Britta Jeff
That part's for resale value. And Saturday afternoons.	|Jeff Britta
You know, downgrading your lifestyle is your chance to grow as a person. Maybe even become one. The less you have, the more you can be. You know what I'm saying?	|Britta Jeff
There's a silver lining here, isn't there? You're attracted to bums.	|Jeff Britta
Good night.	|Britta Jeff
Come on. Why don't you have dinner at my place? I got a hot plate that plugs into a cigarette lighter.	|Jeff Britta
Yeah, but your kitchen's being towed.	|Britta Jeff
Stop! That's my house!	|Jeff Britta
Can I live with you?	|Jeff Abed
Yeah. Cool. You want the top or the bottom bunk?	|Abed Jeff
Top.	|Jeff Abed
Me too. Race you for it I win.	|Abed Jeff
Look, I really need to liquidate some assets. It's an emergency situation. What kind of an offer is that? These are mint condition issues. The premise alone is priceless. The guy has the powers and strength of a spider. No, your incredulity perplexes me, nerd.	|Jeff Extra
Jeff, did I say anything in my sleep about farm animals or Brian Williams?	|Abed Jeff
I don't think so.	|Jeff Abed
Cool. Cool cool cool. Lucky charms?	|Abed Jeff
How are you so satisfied all the time? Don't you ever want anything more out of life than cereal?	|Jeff Abed
Sometimes I like to pour hot cocoa mix into cold milk and drink like it like a cold hot chocolate. I call it "special drink".	|Abed Jeff
And some day you will know it by its true name, "diabetes. "	|Jeff Abed
You're Goldie Hawn, Jeff.	|Abed Jeff
I'm sorry?	|Jeff Abed
You're Goldie Hawn.	|Abed Jeff
Is it the lips?	|Jeff Abed
No. In overboard, she was just like you. Wealthy, assertive, arrogant. Got manicures all the time. But she fell off her boat, good thing for her because, she realized she was happier being poor and rising four boys with Kurt Russell.	|Abed Jeff
Can I not be Kurt Russell?	|Jeff Abed
Do whatever you want. You just have to know what that is. For me, it's Lucky Charms... and tv.	|Abed Jeff
I could use a break.	|Jeff Abed
A picnic blanket. Genius. I was gonna lay down on newspaper.	|Troy Annie
It's the blanket my grandmother used to court my grandfather.	|Annie Troy
Yeah? That's pretty hot. Thanks.	|Troy Annie
Tell that boy how you feel!	|Shirley Annie
It's scary. If he's not interested, I could lose the friendship too.	|Annie Shirley
You could. Love is a gamble always. But waiting won't change the dice. You either roll them or lose your turn.	|Shirley Annie
I'm going to roll them. I am. I just... I need a few more shakes.	|Annie Shirley
Shake 'em in your mind, okay? Excuse me, Pierce's band is playing and I want to record the train wreck. Kind of hoping for a Michael Richards situation.	|Shirley Annie
Oh! They're pretty good. This isn't weird for you?	|Shirley Britta
No. Just want to show Vaughn some support to help smooth things over.	|Britta Shirley
Saying good-bye to Britta was the hardest thing to do. But when someone's a bitch and a liar, there ain't nothing left to woo. I'm getting rid of Britta. What am I doing?	 I'm getting rid of the b.	|Vaughn All
She's a no-good b.	|Pierce All
I'm getting rid of Britta, I'm getting rid of the b.	|Vaughn All
She's a gdb.	|Pierce All
Really great to have somebody to watch stuff with. My dad never wanted to watch anything so I was kind of raised by tv.	|Abed Jeff
Tv's the best dad there is. Tv never came home drunk. Tv never forgot me at the zoo. Tv never abused and insulted me, unless you count Cop Rock.	|Jeff Abed
Cop Rock. That sounds cool.	|Abed Jeff
Doesn't it?	|Jeff Abed
Wow, you guys are really dorming it up in here, huh?	|Britta Jeff
In the last two days, I spent a quarter.	|Jeff Britta
We're having the time of our lives.	|Abed Britta
See? Who needs platinum faucets? Do you guys even have faucets in here?	|Britta Jeff
There's a communal bathroom down the hallway. It actually helped me come to terms with losing my condo. You don't sit on a toilet like that until you've left the material world.	|Jeff Britta
Pavel!	|Abed Pavel
Hey, bros.	|Pavel Jeff Abed
This is Pavel. He lives next door. He's from Poland.	|Jeff Britta
Britta	|Abed Pavel
Britta! I'm getting rid of Britta, getting rid of the b.	|Pavel Jeff Abed
Excuse me, I have a future murder victim to visit.	|Britta Jeff Abed
Cool.	|Jeff Abed
Cool.	|Abed Jeff
Cool cool cool.	|Jeff Abed
Guys, what the hell! "Getting rid of Britta"? That song was disrespectful to me and to the definition of "rhyme scheme".	|Britta Vaughn Pierce
If you don't like my song, you don't have to listen, all right? I'm an artist and I write what I feel. And I feel that you suck.	|Vaughn Britta
All right, hold on here. Can I have a word with you? Could you come here, please, for a second? What'd you say?	|Pierce Vaughn
I know Britta's your friend, but my song is more important.	|Vaughn Pierce
Your song. We wrote it together. Are you trying to Garfunkel me?	|Pierce Vaughn
Maybe. Assuming to "Garfunkel" someone is to keep putting up with them even though they're a fat, lazy cat who hogs the spotlight and eats lasagna.	|Vaughn Pierce
I get it. You're jealous.	|Pierce Vaughn
What? Why?	|Vaughn Pierce
I don't know. Because when I were these skinny jeans, my ass looks like a baby pumpkin. Or because I'm not a small-nippled, credit-hogging jag who only knows three power cords.	|Pierce Vaughn
My band, my song! You want that? How you like that?	|Vaughn Pierce
You get on that horse.	|Pierce Vaughn
Did you just defend my honor?	|Britta Pierce
Oh, yeah, totally.	|Pierce Britta
And you'll light the candles. And you'll take a bite. And she'll take a bite. And you'll laugh. And you'll offer her your letter jacket after you notice this funny way she shakes when she gets cold. And she'll feel like the luckiest girl in the world.	|Annie Troy
Right. I couldn't have done this without your help. You're really nice. We should've hung out more in high school.	|Troy Annie
Remember when you pretended to be my backpack?	|Annie Troy
Oh ho, yeah. yeah.I'm funny. All right. I got to go get ready.	|Troy Annie
Troy, wait! I have to tell you... My appendix is bursting.	|Annie Troy
What?	|Troy Annie
My appendix is bursting.	|Annie Troy
Okay. Two young students. Think I've been to this dance before. You guys are sexual partners, right?	|Nurse Troy Annie
Us? No. He's my very good friend. And I have appendicitis.	|Annie Nurse
Thanks for bringing me here. Guess I ruined your date, huh?	|Annie Troy
Doesn't seem to be anything wrong with you.	|Nurse Annie
Cool. I'll see you.	|Troy Annie
Where does it hurt?	|Nurse Annie
Everywhere.	|Annie Nurse
Okay, we have to quarantine you. We got to get you to a safe distance.	|Nurse Annie
My date's on the east lawn.	|Troy Nurse
East lawn. Perfect. This a date? You'll need these.	|Nurse Troy
Nice. I'll be thinking of you.	|Troy Annie
Okay, I need to go.	|Annie Troy
No, we... We have to observe you overnight. It's policy. We don't want another "Vanessa Parsons" on our hand. She was the "typhoid mary" of herpes. I'm kind of the hawkeye around here so it's kind of a... Are you seeing anybody?	|Nurse Annie
You guys weren't in spanish class.	|Britta Abed Jeff
Knight Rider marathon.	|Jeff Britta
Shadowy flight into the world of a man who does not exist. Britta, may I have a word?	|Abed Britta
Has this always been here?	|Jeff Extra
You need to take Jeff back.	|Abed Britta
Never had him. Don't want him. Especially now. He's got a real Phil Spector vibe going.	|Britta Abed
He's like E.T. He crashed in my place. And we're friends now, it's great for me, but it's bad for him. He needs to get back.	|Abed Britta
What am I supposed to do about that?	|Britta Abed
Use your lady parts.	|Abed Brita
Abed!	|Britta Abed
Don't be naive. The charge between you was keeping him going. Tell him you'll make love to him if he takes a shower and finds a nice place to live.	|Abed Britta
I'm heading back. Pavel's making babka.	|Jeff Abed
Do it. Seduce him. Draw the tapeworm of Jeff out of him with your sexuality.	|Abed Britta
No.	|Britta Abed
Then say good-bye to E.T.	|Abed Britta
Abed, it's open!	|Jeff Abed
What are you doing? That was the Jeffersons, honky.	|Jeff Britta
I was wrong, okay? Material possessions are important. Think how much happier the Jeffersons were than that family on good times.	|Britta Jeff
But they had good times.	|Jeff Britta
Well, do good times really matter? What about good cars, good lobster? What about that... That sport where the British people ride the horses with the really long hammers?	|Britta Jeff
Jeez, you are way out of your element here.	|Jeff Britta
Yes, and I do not believe a single word I am saying for me. But for you, maybe you're one of those rare people with nothing underneath the surface. Maybe if you put stain remover on a turd, you don't get a diamond. You just get a turd with less direction in life.	|Britta Jeff
Thanks, coach. Can you turn the tv back on?	|Jeff Britta
Faucets.	|Britta Jeff
Italian faucets, handcrafted. These look like... Wait... I made this notch to indicate optimal cleansing temperature for combination skin. These were mine?	|Jeff Britta
For a fancy condo, you've got awful security. Install those in a new apartment so that every day, when you're spending way too much time on your hair, you can look down and think, "I was a huge phony before. I can do it again!"	|Britta Jeff
You're into me.	|Jeff Britta
I beg your unbelievable pardon.	|Britta Jeff
Look at all this work you're doing just to have me around again. You were may more attracted to me than you were willing to admit.	|Jeff Britta
I was doing this all for Abed. You are the worst.	|Britta Jeff
Yeah. Clearly.	|Jeff Britta
Vaughn, I just want you to know, I haven't changed my mind. I am out. Also, do me a favor, will you lay off Britta? She may walk like she just got off a horse, but underneath all that clown makeup, she's a good kid.	|Pierce Vaughn
No worries, man. I've moved on. Lates!	|Vaughn Pierce
Lates. Okay. Snakes. What?	|Pierce Vaughn
Pierce, I don't need you in my band. I don't need your heart or your hand. I am my own person, and, Pierce, you're a b. Yeah, you heard me say it. Pierce, you're a b.	|Vaughn All
No! Before you two proceed, I have one thing to say...	|Annie Troy Brandi
Did you... say it already?	|Troy Annie
I want nana's blanket back. Do you guys mind? Could you scoot over? It's an heirloom. I want it back. Thank you. Have a nice date.	|Annie Troy Brandi
I don't care what you think. For me, that was huge.	|Annie Shirley
I know, sweetie. Let's go find you some pants.	|Shirley Annie
This song's for Pierce 'cause he's so old His body made of wrinkles and folds. Stupid and ugly, he smell like a fart, the poo-poo in his pants and poo-poo in my heart.	|Rapper All
Hey, look who the cat dragged out and licked clean.	|Britta Jeff
I saw how much you missed me, and smelled what happens to Pavel on cabbage night, and realized the world was better off with me in it. Thanks... For, uh... Caring.	|Jeff Britta
You look like you moved out.	|Abed Jeff
I checked into a motel and I'm looking for apartments. You would've been fine with me staying there forever?	|Jeff Abed
Yep.	|Abed Jeff
You're pretty cool, Abed.	|Jeff Abed
You're a huge nerd.	|Abed Jeff
Thanks.	|Jeff Abed
I'm Pierce. Yeah. Song's about me.	|Pierce All
East side, west side, North side, south Vaughn's breath is so bad, His butts mad at his mouth This rap is by Pierce, Vaughn is dumb He wears diapers to bed, And sucks his mothers thumb And when he wakes up, Stupid wishing he was me He has a big poop breakfast, With a glass of pee Then he goes to school, Where he's stupid again And everybody hates him, Even all his friends When you come after Pierce, Then the battle is on So this rap goes out, To stupid Vaughn	|Rapper Pierce
Well payed Pierce. This isn't over.	|Vaughn Pierce
Community - 1x09 - Debate 109.HDTV.LOL.en.srt
so then the guy says to the housekeeper, "make sure she's dead." Stop me if you heard this one before.	|Pierce Group
would have been nice to have that option 27 minutes ago.	|Jeff Britta
the housekeeper says to the guy, "we don't have a pool." And the guy says...	|Pierce Group
good morning, greendale! Just a reminder, Our debate team will bring home The championship tomorrow versus city college. Go, human beings!	|Dean All

i really think you should.	|Shirley Britta
absolutely.	|Annie Britta
they say it makes you lose weight, and your skin looks Really great when you do smoke.	|Shirley Britta

ten-to-one says it's him.	|Jeff Britta
his name is pierce hawthorne. And i'm very effective.	|Pierce Britta

i hang on every word.	|Jeff Dean
i'm gonna assume that's sarcasm.	|Dean Jeff
correct.	|Jeff Dean
so you didn't hear my announcement?	|Dean Jeff
i'm barely listening now.	|Jeff Dean
oh.	|Dean Jeff
my debate partner dropped out, And we need you to fill in for him at the championship tonight.	|Annie Jeff
jeffrey, as debate coach, I am offering you an opportunity To spend the night drinking from the cup of life Rather than romancing your nether regions In front of the e! channel.	|Whitman Jeff
come on, jeff. I mean, who better than a former lawyer To really stick it to those city college snobs And their star debater Simmons?	|Dean Jeff
mm, pass.	|Jeff Dean
okay. no, no. Okay, wait. wait. okay, no, no. look. Listen, jerkwad-- i'm sorry. That got heated. Greendale needs a win. The best compliment our sports program gets Is that our basketball team is really gay, So what's it gonna take? You know, a plum parking space, Free meals, A night of companionship if you know what i mean.	|Dean Jeff
i'll do it for the parking space. And if you promise not to tell me what you mean.	|Jeff Dean
okay.	|Dean Whitman Dean
pierce, thank you. I really appreciate you helping me out.	|Britta Pierce
and i appreciate the opportunity. You know, sometimes, i think People don't take me seriously.	|Pierce Britta
so what are you gonna do? Wave a pocket watch in front of my face And tell me i'm getting very sleepy?	|Britta Pierce
Just checking the time. Now close your eyes. Keep them closed at all times. And listen to the soothing sound of my voice. The only word that will bring you out Is gorilla. Okay, now focus on the rhythm Of your own breathing. And when you feel the desire To light up a cigarette, You will associate these urges With things in your life that disgust you. Bad-tasting food. Sex with men. Wearing attractive clothing. And soon... Oh, god, i think i really hurt myself!	|Pierce Britta
Somebody help me.	|Pierce All
Oh, britta, wake up! Why'd i put you under so well? Damn my talent.	|Pierce Britta
topic for debate is "are people inherently good or evil?" So when do you want to get together to strategize?	|Annie Jeff
annie, i was a lawyer. I was a debater for money. I think i can handle this.	|Jeff Annie
How was hypnotherapy?	|Jeff Britta
he fell down and screamed in pain While i laid there with my eyes closed To make him feel like a good hypnotherapist.	|Britta Jeff
you realize this will never end.	|Jeff Britta
it's already done. He just wants one more session.	|Britta Jeff
* wa-wa *	|Jeff Britta
where's abed? I need to talk to him about his films.	|Troy Group
that boy's flat-out prescient. He can read our minds.	|Shirley Group
i know what you're gonna say. You watched my movies on the website.	|Abed Group
he's a witch!	|Shirley Group

by the way, jeff, i think your shirt's trying To get out of your pants.	|Pierce Jeff
as golding's lord of the flies demonstrates, man, When left to his own devices, Will descend into chaos and evil.	|Annie Debate
whoo! And now, from city college, Jeremy simmons.	|Dean All
there were 23,000... Kidney donations in america last year. Man is good. The average life expectancy For a man in a community Is 23 years longer than a man alone. Man is good. And just ten minutes ago, A bald, bespectacled man held the door For a man in a wheelchair.	|Simmons Debate
oh.	|Dean
man is good.	|Simmons Debate
oh. I hate this guy.	|Dean
by the end of this debate, I will prove with facts And data that man is inherently good.	|Simmons Debate
old trick for achieving the proper competitive mindset, I always envision my opponent having aggressive sex With my mother.	|Whitman Jeff
This feels so formal. Let's just talk. People are evil. They can't help it.	|Jeff Debate
I didn't catch your name.	|Jeff Jean
it's jean.	|Jean Jeff
take jean here. She spent a lot of time this morning Making herself look so lovely.	|Jeff Debate
Tell me, jean. How many people bothered to tell you How great you look today?	|Jeff Jean
none.	|Jean Jeff
man is evil.	|Jeff Debate
but you just said how great i looked.	|Jean Jeff
for my own selfish purposes. The fact is, as hot as you look, And it is quite hot, I wouldn't have said anything.	|Jeff Jean
When i talk about people being evil, I could cite quotes or dig up statistics, But those are just words and numbers. I think we could have a little more fun If i express myself in song. * evil woman * * ba na na na na * * evil woman * I knew you could do it. That's my time, everybody. Thank you very much. Yeah!	|Jeff Debate
at the end of round one, City college: 50, Greendale: 8.	|Jean Debate

let's go, boys. come on, let's go. I want to see some hustlers out here. Let's go.	|BasketballCoach All
by zeus, what sort of jackassery is this? We're in the middle of a championship debate.	|Whitman BasketballCoach
we reserved the gym For practice.	|BasketballCoach Whitman
uh, yep. they reserved it. Okay, they've got us by the short ones. The debate is suspended until tomorrow.	|Dean All
Hopefully, by then, we can get our act together.	|Dean Jeff
oh, great try, bruce! great try.	|BasketballCoach Extra
jeff, wait, when are we getting together To prepare for tomorrow?	|Annie Jeff
never, because it's stupid, and i don't care.	|Jeff Annie
Bite me.	|Jeff HumanBeing
maybe simmons is right. You really are all sizzle and no steak. You probably couldn't beat him if you tried.	|Annie Jeff
what do you mean i can't beat him? You and i are gonna study harder Than we've ever studied before And beat city college tomorrow.	|Jeff Annie
really?	|Annie Jeff
no, who am i, iCarly?	|Jeff Annie
abed is right. You act like things don't bother you, but they do.	|Annie Jeff
look, six months ago, i was a lawyer. I wore suits. I used to say stuff like, "objection" and "sidebar." Now i'm losing a community college debate To Jeremy "Soul Patch" Simmons.	|Jeff Annie
hey, winger. You like to sing? I like to sing too. * zero for winger * * ba na na na na na *	|Simmons Jeff
Kick that.	|Simmons Extra
* was a big shot lawyer * * ba na na na na na na * * now he's a lo-ooooo-ser *	|Simmons Jeff

i have this weird pain right above my eyebrow.	|Jeff Annie
it's called a stress headache. I got my first one when i was four.	|Annie Jeff
i hate it.	|Jeff Annie
well, get used to it. You're knee-deep in it now, brother. This is debate. If you want to win, You need to prepare.	|Annie Jeff
well, agreed, but if you want to win, You need to loosen up. Go off book, robot debater.	|Jeff Annie

yes. um, okay. The people are inherently evil.	|Jeff Annie
ooh, we can use this hobbes quote. "man is a collection "of base animal urges. "to act on them and experience "sinful pleasure would be morally no different Than taking a breath." That's poignant, right?	|Annie Jeff
yeah. You know, maybe we should study alone.	|Jeff Annie
yeah.	|Annie Jeff
separately.	|Jeff Annie
uh-huh. That way we can be more reproductive--productive!	|Annie Jeff
Bye!	|Jeff Annie
Bye! oh, you forgot your phone.	|Annie Jeff

the next time you even see a cigarette, You will think of things that disgust you. And while you're under so deep, You'll find yourself attracted To slightly older men. Perhaps, some barrel-chested stud With just enough tummy to love. You'll want to buy him dinner, Then go back to his hot tub. Perhaps, you'll invite one of your friends To join us for a three-way. Maybe someone with low self-esteem And slightly larger breasts.	|Pierce Britta
go to hell, you disgusting pig.	|Britta Pierce
a-ha!	|Pierce Britta
pierce, i was awake the whole time. I was faking it.	|Britta Pierce
i know. I saw you. What do you think i am, some kind of a joke?	|Pierce Britta
no. No, i was trying to make you Feel better about yourself.	|Britta Pierce
how dare you pity me? I may be a little older, My ideas may seem weird, And my fashion sense may cause envy. But i have a lot to offer. And i will not be pitied. Do not help me up.	|Pierce Britta
and as german poet franz wickmeyer once wrote... "snow falls from the heavens pure. "we cannot blame the snow for being... Soiled by the earth." Man is good.	|Simmons Debate

in the stanford prison experiment, 21 out of 21 students, when given absolute power, Abused and tortured their fellow students. My competitor likens people to pure, falling snow. I would respond, "there is none righteous. No, not one." Now i realize mr. simmons' quote Was from the great franz wickmeyer. Mine was just from a simple desert handyman Named jesus.	|Jeff Debate
