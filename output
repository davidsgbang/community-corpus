Speaker: jeff

	pierce

		i was just going to ask.

		definitely!

		Pierce! Let's discuss this creepiness.

		Are you unaware that Shirley Finds your advances inappropriate?

		Pierce, I'd like you to say, "I forgive you."

		I don't have a study group, Pierce. I made it up.

		An excuse to punch a hippy?

		I deserve that.

		You keep getting married.

		Shouldn't you guys be studying?

	group

		I'm gonna go to the bathroom And bring my jacket, wallet, and keys with me In case there's a fire.

		all right. Look at this crew. All ready to study all night.

		but who studies with strangers, right? My name is Jeff.

		you know, i've been a part of a lot of study groups that fell apart because of unresolved tension. Shouldn't we address Annie's concern?  Did we not invite her?

		Dirty Dancing.

		Uh, I'll be right back. But while I'm gone, you guys need to hash this stuff out. No stone unturned. Go!

		All right, everybody! I want to say something. Everybody, sit down.

		You know what makes humans different from other animals?

		We're the only species on Earth that observes Shark Week. Sharks don't even observe Shark Week, but we do. For the same reason I can pick up this pencil, tell you it's name is Steve, and go like this. And part of you dies just a little bit on the inside, because people can connect with anything. We can sympathize with a pencil. We can forgive a shark. And we can give Ben Affleck an Academy Award for Screenwriting.

		People can find the good in just about anything but themselves. Look at me. It's clear to all of you that I am awesome, but I can never admit that, because that would make me an ass. But what I can do is see what makes Annie awesome. She's driven. We need driven people or the lights go out and the ice cream melts. And Pierce. We need guys like Pierce. This guy has wisdom to offer.

		We should listen to him sometime. We wouldn't regret it. And Shirley. Shirley has earned our respect, Not as a wife, not as a mother, but as a woman. And don't test her on that, because that thing about the jukebox was way too specific to be improvised. And Troy. Who cares if Troy thinks he's all that? Maybe he is. You think astronauts go to the moon because they hate oxygen? No! They're trying to impress their high-school prom king. And Abed. Abed's a shaman. You ask him to pass the salt, he gives you a bowl of soup, because you know what? Soup is better. Abed is better. You are all better than you think you are. You are just designed not to believe it when you hear it from yourself.

		I want you to look to the person to your left. Sorry. Look at the person sitting next to you.

		I want you to extend to that person the same compassion that you extend to sharks, pencils, and Ben Affleck. I want you to say to that person, "I forgive you."

		You've just stopped being a study group. You have become something, unstoppable. I hereby pronounce you, a community.

		I agree with Abed that tonight has been very special. And now, if you'll excuse me, I have a dinner engagement with Britta.

		Britta?

		And I'm happy to report that one of the benefits of being a lying creep is having all the answers to tomorrow's test. And I'm happy to share them with anyone whose time I've wasted more than they've wasted mine.

		I make things up, and I got paid a lot of money to do it before I came to this school-shaped toilet. I was a lawyer.

		I don't have any of the answers. I'm gonna-- I'm gonna flunk the test.

		I am me, Well, the funny thing about being smart is that you can get through most of life without ever having to do any work. So, uh, I'm not really sure how to do that.

	extra

		Shouldn't be too hard to fake a study group, right? Oh, geez, I'm sorry, I, I was raised on TV and I was conditioned to believe that every, Black woman over 50 is a cosmic mentor,

		Yes, I'm so sorry. It's Seinfeld.

	self

		Bienvenido.

		oh,they will be, untutorable.

	duncan

		If these guys knew you like I did they would have given you a small office.

		you got to stop saying that.

		Well, 2002 was a simple time.

		i'm a student.

		uh, i am in a bit of a jam. The state bar has suspended my license. They found out my college degree Was less than legitimate.

		now i have to get one from america. and it can't be an email attachment.

		yes, and i'm hoping that our friendship Will yield certain advantages. You know, academic guidance,

		moral support, Every answer to every test For every one of the classes that i'm taking. Here's my schedule.

		okay. Duncan, you, did seem less into integrity The day that i convinced 12 of yours peers that when you made that u-turn on the freeway And tried to order chalupas from the emergency call box, That your only real crime was loving america.

		thank you. Duncan, you are a good man.

		No, and if i wanted to learn something, I wouldn't have come to community college.

		I couldn't stop watching them. There's a guy going for the track, that's older than the game of poker. He's kinda cracking.

		i would say, "go for that," And could have said so in a text.

		i discovered at a very early age That if i talk long enough, I could make anything right or wrong. So either i'm god or truth is relative. And in either case, booyah.

		duncan, you don't have to play shrink  To protect your pride. I accept. you're chicken.

		No, I'm just using regular psychology on a spineless, British twit.

		a six-year-old girl could talk to you that way.

		No, because you're a five-year-old girl And there's a pecking order.

		thank you.

		Hello.

		What's wrong with your voice?

		I knew you could do it, buddy. Thank you.

		The satisfaction of being even.

		What do you want from me?

		My car for a semester's worth of answers?

		You know, bluffs this weak are how your people lost the colonies.

		What am I supposed to drive?

		Yeah, so is wiping your butt with a leaf, but it's not how a man gets around! A golf kart!

		Why are people trying  to teach me things At a school that has an express tuition aisle? Give me the keys.

	troy

		Shouldn't you guys be studying?

		Listen, it doesn't matter. You lose the jacket to please them, you keep it to piss them off, Either way It's for them. That's what's weak,

	abed

		Abed, nice to know you and then meet you in that order. Now about that question that i had--

		Abed?

		what's the deal with the hot girl from spanish class? I can't find a road in there.

		holy crap. Abed, I see your value now.

		why?

		oh, i can't think of a single logical reason why not.

		there you go. Oh, hey, here. Put your contact info down right there. That's right.

		it's probably just for your eyes.

		Well, it's just, You probably,  it's probably just for your eyes.

		do you have to pee?

		hmm.

		well, i'm stumped. That's very creepy. That's very creepy.

		no, it's just someone With a misguided grasp of abbreviation.

		I just need five minutes, you guys, So go ahead and study all the verbs,in spanish.

		you guys aren't gonna believe this, But the rest of the group, Is here.

		where's Britta?

		it's the coolest.

		Well, uh, that-- That actually was from The Breakfast Club.

		Yeah.

		Yeah?

		Well, you have Asperger's.

		Well, that's the nicest thing anyone's ever said to me.

	annie

		Made it up. That's what I do.

	britta

		oh, hey! spanish.

		whoa.  I wouldn't dream of it. I just wanted to let you know about my spanish study group.

		i'm taking the class as an easy credit. I'm actually a spanish tutor.

		Board certified.

		yeah, i was willing to bet, i'm Jeff. Or "Jefe". We meet at the library at 4:00.

		You gonna be there? Un po' di piu'. That means "See you there".

		Bienvenuto! Hey, all right, come on in.  I got the whole table. Welcome.

		Yeah, here's the, uh, contact sheet. Just put your stuff there. Man. Rest of the group is running late. But you and i can get acquainted.

		yeah, i like big talk. what's your deal?

		what's your deal and is god dead?

		You'd be surprised what gets back to these guys.

		Marry me.

		honesty?

		ah, that's a good deal.

		uh, i would have to go-- I would have to say, um, honesty, Because, I would say anything to get what i want. And i want you to like me. So, uh,

		really? Wow. you're easy.

		I just need five minutes, you guys, So go ahead and study all the verbs,in spanish.

		you guys aren't gonna believe this, But the rest of the group, Is here.

		uh, listen.

		yeah, but they're filtered, so that makes them safe.

		yeah, not mine, actually. I think Abed took out a page on craigslist. And i was trained never to say this, But i think that group may be untutorable.

		so why don't you and i go study over--

		or drinks.

		i'm certified.

		Yeah, untutorable. You like Thai food? I love Thai food.

		Why can't you see that for the compliment that it is? Ok, ok. I'm sorry. It was an accident. I did a little bit of lying  to get close to you. But how was I suppose to know that you were smart and cool, I mean, you look like Elisabeth Shue.

		What do you want me to do?

		Okay, if i do that, then dinner, right?

		Oh, you're gonna eat those words when you see my new car.

		Fine.

		Really?

	shirley

		please, Shirley.



Speaker: pierce

	group

		i'm also a toast master, so perhaps I should do the introductions.

		I am a prominent business leader And a highly sought after dinner guest And i will not take courting advice From some teenage boy.

		Big mistake.

		The Dalai Lama and I--

		Sounds good.

	jeff

		Uh, Jeff, if you have all the answers, why the hell did you start this study group?

		I never looked at it that way.

	self

		"Ass-burger".

	troy

	abed

		there's breakfast?

		Soup?

	annie

		If it's so serious, why don't they call it meningitis?

	shirley

		sexually harassing? what? That makes no sense to me. Why would i harass somebody who turns me on?

		If it's so serious, why don't they call it meningitis?



Speaker: dean

	self

		Good morning. How do we turn this off?  Mother, you think you can come and help me turn it off? How do we turn this off? Can you help me with this? Oh, thank you, thank you so much. I didn't mean to snap. uh, good morning. Many of you are halfway through your first week here at greendale and as your dean, i thought i would share a few thoughts of wisdom and inspiration. What is community college? Well, you've heard all kinds of things. You've heard it's "loser college for remedial teens, 20-something dropouts, middle-age divorcees, and old people keeping their minds active as they circle the drain of eternity." That's what you heard. However, i wish you luck! Okay, you know-- uh-oh. Okay, there's more to this speech. There's actually a middle card that is missing. Can we all look around our immediate areas, 'cause i really wanted to--



Speaker: duncan

	jeff

		Jeff Winger! Genius at law.

		i will never do that. sit down I still cannot figure out how you gonna join September the 11th with my DUI, that alone, why that helped.

		So what is my lawyer doing here?

		well, that cannot be an inspiring journey.

		i thought you had a bachelor's from columbia.

		well, you've picked a fine school.

		yes.

		no. Now, Jeff, just by asking that, You have insulted the integrity of this entire institution.

		Well, I do love America, I do love it, very much. I love chalupas. But, i'll look into it. 

		Jeff, are you familiar with the adage, "cheaters never prosper"?

		Act natural, pretend you are watching the athletic proceedings.

		suppose i was to say to you It was possible to get those test answers?

		i'm asking you if you know the difference Between right and wrong.

		oh, interesting. It's just the average person has a much harder time saying, "booyah," to moral relativism.

		Are you trying to use reverse psychology on a psychologist?

		i'm a professor. you can't talk to me that way.

		yes, because that would be adorable!

		fine! i'll do it!

		yeah, pleasure. Bye! Yes! good! Why am i still shouting? I'm drawing attention to myself.

		It's Professor Duncan. Come to the parking lot now.

		I'm disguising it.

		Get in the car! Act as if either you have just finished or yet to begin driving. Every answer to every test in your curriculum this semester.

		Whoa there, grabby-grabby. What do I get?

		Even, fairness, right, wrong. There is no God. Booyah, booyah.

		Your Lexus.

		Will it be just a semester though, Jeff? Won't you be taking the easy way out for the next four years? I want payment in advance. I want leather seats with built-in ball warmers.

		Have a nice disbarment hearing.

		Why don't you take this car? It's good for the earth.

		Jeffrey, before you say anything, you may want to think about the gift you've been given.

		No. No, not that. An important lesson, my friend. You see, the tools you acquired to survive out there will not help you here at Greendale. What you have, my friend, is a second chance at an honest life.

		No, I have to keep your car for-- Don't hit me. Please, don't hit me. Jeffrey, Jeffrey! Are we cool? Are we cool? We're cool.

	extra

		Absolutely not.

		Waster! not a bathroom! Not a bathroom.



Speaker: extra

	jeff

Speaker: troy

	pierce

		"Troy".

		saying she turns you on is the harassment, dude.

		well, this teenage boy  is a quarterback and a prom king.

		He's got a point.

		I forgive you.

	group

		Wait, you're that girl that got hooked on pills and then dropped out. You're little Annie "Adderall".

		Feet.

		Yeah, things got kind of boring after you left. Let me ask you something. People becloud me for wearing this jacket ever since I got here, but  If I take it off to make them happy, That just makes me weak, right?

		Wow. You just wrinkled my brain, man.

		You just, like, study for, like, an hour. It's not that hard. You seem pretty smart. You got a sports coat.

		No pressure.

	self

		"Ass-burger".

	annie

		how'd you know i went there?

		Keg flip. They're very hard to pull off. You don't know-- I'm a legend.

	shirley

Speaker: group

	self

		Oh, God.

	abed

		Yes.



Speaker: abed

	britta

		cool, cool, cool. Cool, cool, cool. hey, this is kind of like breakfast club, huh?

		yeah. i'm sure we've each got an issue balled up inside of us  that would make us cry if we talked about it.

		Oh. hey, text message. Let's give this bad boy a read.

		I've never got one of these

		"say you have to pee. i need to talk to you."

		"say you have to pee."

		Yeah?

		You look like Elisabeth Shue.

		What did he say?

	pierce

		sure.

	group

		this is getting way more like breakfast club now.

		You know what I got for Christmas? It was a banner year at the Bender family. I got a carton of cigarettes. The old man grabbed me, he said, "Hey, smoke up, Johnny!" "No, dad! What about you?"

		I can't feel my,

		What's going on? Can you guys hear me? Am I deaf? Can you hear me talking right now?

		That's good.

	jeff

		i'm only half-arabic, actually. My dad is palestinian. He's a u.s. citizen. He's not a threat to national security or anything. A lot of people want to know that after they meet him, because he has an angry energy. But not, like, angry at america. Just angry at my mom for leaving him. Although she did leave because he was angry and he was angry because she's american. My name's Abed, by the way.

		oh, uh, 5 after 11:00 when you asked.

		yeah?

		well, i only talked to her once While she was borrowing a pencil, but, Her name is Britta, she's 28, birthday in october, She has two older brothers and one of 'em Works with children who have a disorder I might want to look up. Oh, and she thinks she's gonna flunk Tomorrow's test, so she really needs to focus So she's sorry if that makes her seem cold.

		that's the nicest thing anyone's ever said to me.

		Britta invited me. is that cool?

		cool.

		cool, cool, cool. Cool, cool, cool. hey, this is kind of like breakfast club, huh?

		yeah. i'm sure we've each got an issue balled up inside of us  that would make us cry if we talked about it.

		well, i got a little doozy in the chamber if things get emotional.

		Oh. hey, text message. Let's give this bad boy a read.

		I've never got one of these

		"say you have to pee. i need to talk to you."

		"say you have to pee. I need to talk to you."

		no.

		that's so weird.

		does it say you have to pee?

		not sure. But i invited more people from spanish class. Is that cool? 

		Nobody puts baby in the corner.

		This?

		This isn't like Breakfast Club anymore. Now it's like Stripes or Meatballs. Anything with Bill Murray, really.

		You know, I thought you were like Bill Murray in any of his films, but you're more like Michael Douglas in any of his films.

		Yeah.

		I'm sorry I called you Michael Douglas and I see your value now.



Speaker: annie

	shirley

		can we stop with the "pumpkins" and the "sweeties"? Being younger does not make me inferior. If anything, your age indicates That you've made bad life decisions.

		I forgive you.

	pierce

		"Annie".

	group

		i'd like to know why i had to find out About this group on accident?

	troy

		you're not prom king anymore, Troy. This isn't riverside high.

		because you're still wearing your stupid letter jacket. And more importantly, I sat behind you in Algebra.

		Yes, and you are a stupid jock who lost his scholarship by dislocating both shoulders in a keg stand.

		It's a serious disorder.

	jeff

		what board certifies a tutor?

		What about the "Look Left" speech?



Speaker: britta

	abed

		Abed in the house!

		we are in a library.

		do you have something balled up inside of you?

		that is weird.

		Abed,

		What's your read on that guy?

	group

		okay, um, maybe we should get started--

		okay. Why don't we try learning "jukebox" in spanish?

		Everybody ready?

	pierce

		Britta.

	jeff

		uh, don't hit on me, okay?

		the guy who's playing bejeweled on his iphone all class has a study group? Um, can i sign up twice?

		can you say that in spanish now?

		i really need help with spanish.

		yeah, Britta. thanks.

		Yeah. We have the whole room.

		you may have noticed this morning, Not so good at the small talk.

		that's not small talk?

		all right, you want to know my deal? I dropped out of high-school because I thought for some reason  it would impress Radiohead.

		I joined the peace corp. I did a little foot modelling, I got tear gased in a World Trade Rally,

		And I think, Jeff, my deal is above all else, honesty.

		yeah. You tell me the truth, i will like you. You lie to me, i will never talk to you again. That's my deal.

		So what's your deal?

		wow. that's a very honest answer. All right, now i like you fine.

		hell yeah.

		and busted.

		now you know. I'm a smoker.

		you ready to get started? Looks like the rest of your group showed up.

		oh, really?

		dinner?

		i think, actually, we should prioritize here And study first and then go to dinner. And if they really prove to be untutorable, we'll slip out early.

		what are you doing?

		It is a disaster in there.

		Wait, so, this is a game to you? You put human beings into a state of emotional shambles for a shot at getting in my pants?

		You're unbelievable.

		Oh, maybe one decent thing could be to go in there and clean up your mess.

		Yeah, fine, whatever. As if there's a dinner on Earth that could make me forget you are a shallow douchebag.

		I lied. Thanks for calming everyone down. but since you're not a Spanish tutor, just a lying creep who purposely upset everyone in an attempt to get with me, I'd appreciate it if you left and stopped wasting all of our time.

		Shouldn't you be rolling around on a bed covered in test answers?

		You know what? Jeff, actually, we didn't get that far without you, so if you want to come back upstairs--

		Well, it is your study group, so.



Speaker: shirley

	troy

		that's borderline racist, i think.

		It really is.

	group

		should we go with him?

		well, i can stay at least till 10:00.

		Oh, that's nice. I like that.

		That explains everything.

	pierce

		what are you doing?

		you have been sexually harassing me Since the very first day of class.

	annie

		okay, okay. I'm sure i've made some bad life decisions And maybe Annie's decisions will be better. But i think she needs to decide Whether she wants to be considered a child Or an adult, because children get pity But not respect. And adults,  they get respect, But they also get the back of they head grabbed  And their face pushed through jukeboxes.

		I forgive you.

	jeff

		i need to call my babysitter If we're gon' be later than 10:00.

		well, Annie, sweetie, it's not behind your back. We just didn't think about,

		no, no, no. i don't.

		You don't have to yell.

		Look at her? Okay.

		He didn't say it?

		Come on, let's study.

	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: britta
what's your deal and is god dead?
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: jeff
all right, you want to know my deal? I dropped out of high-school because I thought for some reason  it would impress Radiohead.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: britta
You'd be surprised what gets back to these guys.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: jeff
I joined the peace corp. I did a little foot modelling, I got tear gased in a World Trade Rally,

ah, that's a good deal.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: jeff
So what's your deal?
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: britta
uh, i would have to go-- I would have to say, um, honesty, Because, I would say anything to get what i want. And i want you to like me. So, uh,

hell yeah.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: abed
Abed in the house!
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: abed
why?
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: jeff
Britta invited me. is that cool?
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: abed
oh, i can't think of a single logical reason why not.
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: jeff
cool.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: abed
there you go. Oh, hey, here. Put your contact info down right there. That's right.
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: jeff britta
cool, cool, cool. Cool, cool, cool. hey, this is kind of like breakfast club, huh?
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: abed
we are in a library.
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: jeff britta
yeah. i'm sure we've each got an issue balled up inside of us  that would make us cry if we talked about it.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: abed
do you have something balled up inside of you?
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: jeff
well, i got a little doozy in the chamber if things get emotional.
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: jeff britta
Oh. hey, text message. Let's give this bad boy a read.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: abed
it's probably just for your eyes.
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: jeff britta
I've never got one of these
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: abed
Well, it's just, You probably,  it's probably just for your eyes.
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: jeff britta
"say you have to pee. i need to talk to you."
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: britta
"say you have to pee."
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: abed
that is weird.
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: jeff
"say you have to pee. I need to talk to you."
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: abed
do you have to pee?
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: jeff
no.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: abed
hmm.
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: jeff
that's so weird.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: abed
well, i'm stumped. That's very creepy. That's very creepy.
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: jeff
does it say you have to pee?
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: abed
no, it's just someone With a misguided grasp of abbreviation.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: abed britta
I just need five minutes, you guys, So go ahead and study all the verbs,in spanish.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: abed
Abed,
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: britta
Yeah?
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: abed
What's your read on that guy?
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: britta
You look like Elisabeth Shue.



	Speaker: duncan	Listeners: jeff
Act natural, pretend you are watching the athletic proceedings.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: duncan
I couldn't stop watching them. There's a guy going for the track, that's older than the game of poker. He's kinda cracking.
	Speaker: duncan	Listeners: jeff
suppose i was to say to you It was possible to get those test answers?
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: duncan
i would say, "go for that," And could have said so in a text.
	Speaker: duncan	Listeners: jeff
i'm asking you if you know the difference Between right and wrong.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: duncan
i discovered at a very early age That if i talk long enough, I could make anything right or wrong. So either i'm god or truth is relative. And in either case, booyah.
	Speaker: duncan	Listeners: jeff
oh, interesting. It's just the average person has a much harder time saying, "booyah," to moral relativism.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: duncan
duncan, you don't have to play shrink  To protect your pride. I accept. you're chicken.
	Speaker: duncan	Listeners: jeff
Are you trying to use reverse psychology on a psychologist?
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: duncan
No, I'm just using regular psychology on a spineless, British twit.
	Speaker: duncan	Listeners: jeff
i'm a professor. you can't talk to me that way.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: duncan
a six-year-old girl could talk to you that way.
	Speaker: duncan	Listeners: jeff
yes, because that would be adorable!
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: duncan
No, because you're a five-year-old girl And there's a pecking order.
	Speaker: duncan	Listeners: jeff
fine! i'll do it!
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: duncan
thank you.
	Speaker: duncan	Listeners: jeff
yeah, pleasure. Bye! Yes! good! Why am i still shouting? I'm drawing attention to myself.



	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: britta abed
you guys aren't gonna believe this, But the rest of the group, Is here.
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: jeff
are you the board-certified tutor?
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: jeff
that means you do my homework, right, Seacrest?
	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: jeff
i need to call my babysitter If we're gon' be later than 10:00.
	Speaker: annie	Listeners: jeff
what board certifies a tutor?
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: abed
where's Britta?
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: jeff
not sure. But i invited more people from spanish class. Is that cool? 
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: abed
it's the coolest.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: group
I'm gonna go to the bathroom And bring my jacket, wallet, and keys with me In case there's a fire.
	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: group
should we go with him?
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: group
i'm leaving my homework with slumdog millionaire over here.
	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: troy
that's borderline racist, i think.



	Speaker: britta	Listeners: jeff
and busted.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: britta
uh, listen.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: jeff
now you know. I'm a smoker.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: britta
yeah, but they're filtered, so that makes them safe.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: jeff
you ready to get started? Looks like the rest of your group showed up.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: britta
yeah, not mine, actually. I think Abed took out a page on craigslist. And i was trained never to say this, But i think that group may be untutorable.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: jeff
oh, really?
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: britta
so why don't you and i go study over--
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: jeff
dinner?
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: britta
or drinks.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: jeff
i think, actually, we should prioritize here And study first and then go to dinner. And if they really prove to be untutorable, we'll slip out early.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: self
oh,they will be, untutorable.



	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: group
all right. Look at this crew. All ready to study all night.
	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: group
well, i can stay at least till 10:00.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: group
but who studies with strangers, right? My name is Jeff.
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: jeff
Jeff, it's a pleasure. My name is Pierce Hawthorne and, yes, That is Hawthorne as in Hawthorne wipes, The award-winning moist towellete.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: pierce
i was just going to ask.
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: group
i'm also a toast master, so perhaps I should do the introductions.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: pierce
definitely!
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: jeff
all right, you already know brittles.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: pierce
Britta.
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: jeff
Abed. Abed the arab. Is that inappropriate?
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: pierce
sure.
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: jeff
roy. roy the wonder boy.
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: pierce
"Troy".
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: jeff
little princess elizabeth.
	Speaker: annie	Listeners: pierce
"Annie".
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: jeff
and finally, this beautiful creature is named Shirley.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: shirley
is that even close?



	Speaker: annie	Listeners: group
i'd like to know why i had to find out About this group on accident?
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: group
this is getting way more like breakfast club now.
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: abed
there's breakfast?
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: group
okay, um, maybe we should get started--
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: group
you know, i've been a part of a lot of study groups that fell apart because of unresolved tension. Shouldn't we address Annie's concern?  Did we not invite her?
	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: jeff
well, Annie, sweetie, it's not behind your back. We just didn't think about,
	Speaker: annie	Listeners: shirley
can we stop with the "pumpkins" and the "sweeties"? Being younger does not make me inferior. If anything, your age indicates That you've made bad life decisions.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: shirley
Shirley has a response to that.
	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: jeff
no, no, no. i don't.
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: shirley
you should. it looks like you do.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: shirley
please, Shirley.
	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: annie
okay, okay. I'm sure i've made some bad life decisions And maybe Annie's decisions will be better. But i think she needs to decide Whether she wants to be considered a child Or an adult, because children get pity But not respect. And adults,  they get respect, But they also get the back of they head grabbed  And their face pushed through jukeboxes.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: group
okay. Why don't we try learning "jukebox" in spanish?
	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: pierce
what are you doing?
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: pierce
Pierce! Let's discuss this creepiness.
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: jeff
pardon you?
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: pierce
Are you unaware that Shirley Finds your advances inappropriate?
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: jeff
what advances?
	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: pierce
you have been sexually harassing me Since the very first day of class.
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: shirley
sexually harassing? what? That makes no sense to me. Why would i harass somebody who turns me on?
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: pierce
saying she turns you on is the harassment, dude.
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: troy
hey.
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: group
I am a prominent business leader And a highly sought after dinner guest And i will not take courting advice From some teenage boy.
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: pierce
well, this teenage boy  is a quarterback and a prom king.



	Speaker: britta	Listeners: jeff
what are you doing?
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: britta
i'm certified.



	Speaker: annie	Listeners: troy
you're not prom king anymore, Troy. This isn't riverside high.
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: annie
how'd you know i went there?
	Speaker: annie	Listeners: troy
because you're still wearing your stupid letter jacket. And more importantly, I sat behind you in Algebra.
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: jeff
Wait, you're that girl that got hooked on pills and then dropped out. You're little Annie "Adderall".
	Speaker: annie	Listeners: troy
Yes, and you are a stupid jock who lost his scholarship by dislocating both shoulders in a keg stand.
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: annie
Keg flip. They're very hard to pull off. You don't know-- I'm a legend.



	Speaker: abed	Listeners: group
You know what I got for Christmas? It was a banner year at the Bender family. I got a carton of cigarettes. The old man grabbed me, he said, "Hey, smoke up, Johnny!" "No, dad! What about you?"
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: abed
Well, uh, that-- That actually was from The Breakfast Club.
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: jeff
Nobody puts baby in the corner.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: group
Dirty Dancing.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: group
Uh, I'll be right back. But while I'm gone, you guys need to hash this stuff out. No stone unturned. Go!
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: group
What does that,
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: group
I can't feel my,
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: group
Okay, I am the Barack Obama of this room.



	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: duncan
Hello.
	Speaker: duncan	Listeners: jeff
It's Professor Duncan. Come to the parking lot now.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: duncan
What's wrong with your voice?
	Speaker: duncan	Listeners: jeff
I'm disguising it.



	Speaker: duncan	Listeners: jeff
Get in the car! Act as if either you have just finished or yet to begin driving. Every answer to every test in your curriculum this semester.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: duncan
I knew you could do it, buddy. Thank you.
	Speaker: duncan	Listeners: jeff
Whoa there, grabby-grabby. What do I get?
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: duncan
The satisfaction of being even.
	Speaker: duncan	Listeners: jeff
Even, fairness, right, wrong. There is no God. Booyah, booyah.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: duncan
What do you want from me?
	Speaker: duncan	Listeners: jeff
Your Lexus.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: duncan
My car for a semester's worth of answers?
	Speaker: duncan	Listeners: jeff
Will it be just a semester though, Jeff? Won't you be taking the easy way out for the next four years? I want payment in advance. I want leather seats with built-in ball warmers.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: duncan
You know, bluffs this weak are how your people lost the colonies.
	Speaker: duncan	Listeners: jeff
Have a nice disbarment hearing.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: duncan
What am I supposed to drive?
	Speaker: duncan	Listeners: jeff
Why don't you take this car? It's good for the earth.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: duncan
Yeah, so is wiping your butt with a leaf, but it's not how a man gets around! A golf kart!



	Speaker: britta	Listeners: jeff
It is a disaster in there.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: britta
Yeah, untutorable. You like Thai food? I love Thai food.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: jeff
Wait, so, this is a game to you? You put human beings into a state of emotional shambles for a shot at getting in my pants?
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: britta
Why can't you see that for the compliment that it is? Ok, ok. I'm sorry. It was an accident. I did a little bit of lying  to get close to you. But how was I suppose to know that you were smart and cool, I mean, you look like Elisabeth Shue.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: jeff
You're unbelievable.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: britta
What do you want me to do?
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: jeff
Oh, maybe one decent thing could be to go in there and clean up your mess.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: britta
Okay, if i do that, then dinner, right?
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: jeff
Yeah, fine, whatever. As if there's a dinner on Earth that could make me forget you are a shallow douchebag.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: britta
Oh, you're gonna eat those words when you see my new car.



	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: group
All right, everybody! I want to say something. Everybody, sit down.
	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: jeff
You don't have to yell.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: group
You know what makes humans different from other animals?
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: jeff
Feet.
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: troy
No, no, no, come on. Bears have feet.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: group
We're the only species on Earth that observes Shark Week. Sharks don't even observe Shark Week, but we do. For the same reason I can pick up this pencil, tell you it's name is Steve, and go like this. And part of you dies just a little bit on the inside, because people can connect with anything. We can sympathize with a pencil. We can forgive a shark. And we can give Ben Affleck an Academy Award for Screenwriting.
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: group
Big mistake.
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: pierce
He's got a point.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: group
People can find the good in just about anything but themselves. Look at me. It's clear to all of you that I am awesome, but I can never admit that, because that would make me an ass. But what I can do is see what makes Annie awesome. She's driven. We need driven people or the lights go out and the ice cream melts. And Pierce. We need guys like Pierce. This guy has wisdom to offer.
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: group
The Dalai Lama and I--
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: group
We should listen to him sometime. We wouldn't regret it. And Shirley. Shirley has earned our respect, Not as a wife, not as a mother, but as a woman. And don't test her on that, because that thing about the jukebox was way too specific to be improvised. And Troy. Who cares if Troy thinks he's all that? Maybe he is. You think astronauts go to the moon because they hate oxygen? No! They're trying to impress their high-school prom king. And Abed. Abed's a shaman. You ask him to pass the salt, he gives you a bowl of soup, because you know what? Soup is better. Abed is better. You are all better than you think you are. You are just designed not to believe it when you hear it from yourself.
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: abed
Soup?
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: group
I want you to look to the person to your left. Sorry. Look at the person sitting next to you.
	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: jeff
Look at her? Okay.
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: jeff
This?
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: abed
Yeah.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: group
I want you to extend to that person the same compassion that you extend to sharks, pencils, and Ben Affleck. I want you to say to that person, "I forgive you."
	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: annie
I forgive you.
	Speaker: annie	Listeners: shirley
I forgive you.
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: pierce
I forgive you.
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: troy
You little twerp.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: pierce
Pierce, I'd like you to say, "I forgive you."
	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: jeff
He didn't say it?
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: troy
I forgive you.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: group
You've just stopped being a study group. You have become something, unstoppable. I hereby pronounce you, a community.
	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: group
Oh, that's nice. I like that.
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: jeff
This isn't like Breakfast Club anymore. Now it's like Stripes or Meatballs. Anything with Bill Murray, really.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: group
I agree with Abed that tonight has been very special. And now, if you'll excuse me, I have a dinner engagement with Britta.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: group
Britta?
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: jeff
I lied. Thanks for calming everyone down. but since you're not a Spanish tutor, just a lying creep who purposely upset everyone in an attempt to get with me, I'd appreciate it if you left and stopped wasting all of our time.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: group
Everybody ready?
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: britta
Fine.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: group
And I'm happy to report that one of the benefits of being a lying creep is having all the answers to tomorrow's test. And I'm happy to share them with anyone whose time I've wasted more than they've wasted mine.
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: jeff
Uh, Jeff, if you have all the answers, why the hell did you start this study group?
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: pierce
I don't have a study group, Pierce. I made it up.
	Speaker: annie	Listeners: jeff
What about the "Look Left" speech?
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: annie
Made it up. That's what I do.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: group
I make things up, and I got paid a lot of money to do it before I came to this school-shaped toilet. I was a lawyer.
	Speaker: group	Listeners: self
Oh, God.
	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: group
That explains everything.
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: jeff
You know, I thought you were like Bill Murray in any of his films, but you're more like Michael Douglas in any of his films.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: abed
Yeah?
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: jeff
Yeah.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: abed
Well, you have Asperger's.
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: britta
What did he say?
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: self
"Ass-burger".
	Speaker: annie	Listeners: troy
It's a serious disorder.
	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: troy
It really is.
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: annie shirley
If it's so serious, why don't they call it meningitis?
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: self
"Ass-burger".
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: pierce
Burger for your ass.



	Speaker: duncan	Listeners: jeff
Jeffrey, before you say anything, you may want to think about the gift you've been given.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: pierce
An excuse to punch a hippy?
	Speaker: duncan	Listeners: jeff
No. No, not that. An important lesson, my friend. You see, the tools you acquired to survive out there will not help you here at Greendale. What you have, my friend, is a second chance at an honest life.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: duncan
Why are people trying  to teach me things At a school that has an express tuition aisle? Give me the keys.
	Speaker: duncan	Listeners: jeff
No, I have to keep your car for-- Don't hit me. Please, don't hit me. Jeffrey, Jeffrey! Are we cool? Are we cool? We're cool.



	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: jeff
I like you, Jeffrey. You remind me of myself at your age.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: pierce
I deserve that.
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: jeff
You know, I've been divorced seven times. Sometimes, I think I'm doing something wrong.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: pierce
You keep getting married.
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: jeff
I never looked at it that way.



	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: pierce troy
Shouldn't you guys be studying?
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: jeff
Yeah, things got kind of boring after you left. Let me ask you something. People becloud me for wearing this jacket ever since I got here, but  If I take it off to make them happy, That just makes me weak, right?
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: troy
Listen, it doesn't matter. You lose the jacket to please them, you keep it to piss them off, Either way It's for them. That's what's weak,
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: jeff
Wow. You just wrinkled my brain, man.
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: troy
He's good, isn't he?
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: pierce
He's really good.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: jeff
Shouldn't you be rolling around on a bed covered in test answers?
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: group
I don't have any of the answers. I'm gonna-- I'm gonna flunk the test.
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: jeff
You just, like, study for, like, an hour. It's not that hard. You seem pretty smart. You got a sports coat.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: group
I am me, Well, the funny thing about being smart is that you can get through most of life without ever having to do any work. So, uh, I'm not really sure how to do that.
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: group
What's going on? Can you guys hear me? Am I deaf? Can you hear me talking right now?
	Speaker: group	Listeners: abed
Yes.
	Speaker: abed	Listeners: group
That's good.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: jeff
You know what? Jeff, actually, we didn't get that far without you, so if you want to come back upstairs--
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: britta
Really?
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: jeff
Well, it is your study group, so.
	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: jeff
Come on, let's study.
	Speaker: pierce	Listeners: group
Sounds good.
	Speaker: troy	Listeners: jeff
No pressure.



	Speaker: abed	Listeners: jeff
I'm sorry I called you Michael Douglas and I see your value now.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: abed
Well, that's the nicest thing anyone's ever said to me.



	Speaker: duncan	Listeners: extra
Absolutely not.
	Speaker: duncan	Listeners: extra
Waster! not a bathroom! Not a bathroom.
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: extra
Shouldn't be too hard to fake a study group, right? Oh, geez, I'm sorry, I, I was raised on TV and I was conditioned to believe that every, Black woman over 50 is a cosmic mentor,
	Speaker: extra	Listeners: jeff
Were you conditioned to pay for your damn taco, Sanfield?
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: extra
Yes, I'm so sorry. It's Seinfeld.
