Before we wrap up, i would like to thank you guys For filling out these anonymous evaluation cards. I found your feedback To be largely constructive and flattering, So gracias on that.	|Chang All	|01
De nada.	|Abed Chang	|01
You don't have to sign your name anymore.	|Chang Abed	|01
Got it.	|Abed Chang	|01
But there was one evaluation That was so harsh and hurtful And racist That i took the time personally To analyze that handwriting against past exams. And this particular coward Dots her is with tiny, Itty-Bitty, little circles. Boop. Boop. Tcch! Isn't that precious and cute? Who's "erratic and unstable" now, Princess Gringa?	|Chang Annie	|01
Nice day out today, isn't it?	|Shirley Jeff	|02
Yeah. Shoot!	|Jeff Shirley	|02
You forget something?	|Britta Jeff	|03
Yeah. I forgot to stagger the timing of my exit with shirley's. We both have a class across campus, and i can't go That kind of distance with "ooh, that's nice."	|Jeff Britta	|03
That's mean.	|Britta Jeff	|03
No. that's not nice.	|Jeff Britta	|03
I find shirley very easy to talk to, And besides, aren't you supposed to have, Like, an olympic gold medal in jibber-Jabber?	|Britta Jeff	|03
Yeah, but i'm a sprinter. I am at my best during high-Speed bursts of wit. On a shirley walk, i'd be winded by that stoner tree.	|Jeff Britta	|03
Hey, britta, hi. What's up?	|Vaughn Britta	|04
Hey, vaughn, how's it going?	|Britta Vaughn	|04
No worries.	|Vaughn Britta	|04
Interesting. 'Cause i might be worried If i was playing hacky sack a decade too late.	|Jeff Britta	|04
My class is that way.	|Britta Jeff	|04
All right, but i just wanted to point out That we easily walked more than 100 yards With no awkward pauses, And that is the sign of a true friend.	|Jeff Britta	|04
I am really glad that you're not hitting on me anymore.	|Britta Jeff	|04
There's the awkward pause.	|Jeff Britta	|04
Excuse me. Oh, sorry, ladies.	|Annie Extra	|05
Professor duncan! Professor duncan!	|Annie Duncan	|05
What?	|Duncan Annie	|05
Excuse me. Annie edison. I am in your 101 lecture.	|Annie Duncan	|05
Hello.	|Duncan Annie	|05
I've heard about your special psych lab.	|Annie Duncan	|05
Ah. The duncan principle.	|Duncan Annie	|05
Yes. And i know it's limited to second-Year students, But i had a 4.0 at riverside high, And i'm not looking down on this school at all, But i'm only here because of a brief addiction to pills That i was told would help me...focus, But they actually made me lose my scholarship and virginity. So--	|Annie Duncan	|05
Right.	|Duncan Annie	|05
If you would let me take your lab early, It would be a real feather in my transcript.	|Annie Duncan	|05
Okay, i've actually been in this situation many times, So i'm just going to be up front. I am not allowed to date students.	|Duncan Annie	|05
Oh!	|Annie Duncan	|05
Even though you're an eight.	|Duncan Annie	|05
Oh!	|Annie Duncan	|05
Which is a british ten, So i'm angry.	|Duncan Annie	|05
Oh!	|Annie Duncan	|05
But if, in spite of that, you are still interested, Then you may join the lab. Ah! Okay. You need to bring two human subjects. And it would not hurt your chances one bit If you could lend me a fiver. I seem to have left my purse in my duffle And my duffle in the boot of my lorry, so--	|Duncan Annie	|05
Oh.	|Annie Duncan	|05
I asked politely, and then panda took his pants off.	|Vaughn Britta	|06
I never even knew that's what asexual meant.	|Britta Vaughn	|06
I wonder what this express package could be? Somebody had to get something to me very fast.	|Pierce Group	|07
You brought your mail to campus?	|Shirley Pierce	|07
Oh, yes. My ear-Noculars.	|Pierce Group	|07
What is that? It looks like your bluetooth thingie.	|Troy Pierce	|07
No, no, no, no, no. This is my cell phone headset. And this is ear-Noculars. It's for spies and whatnot. It gives you sonic hearing.	|Pierce Troy	|07
All hearing is sonic.	|Abed Pierce	|07
What's that?	|Pierce Group	|07
So who wants to be in a psych experiment?	|Annie Group	|08
Hey, guys, guys, guys? Annie is talking about some kind of experiment.	|Pierce Group	|08
She's behind you. Not interested.	|Jeff Pierce	|08
Please? You get paid.	|Annie Group	|08
Do they do stuff to your butt?	|Troy Annie	|08
No.	|Annie Troy	|08
Do you get paid more if they do stuff to your butt?	|Troy Annie	|08
No.	|Annie Troy	|08
That's fine. I will do it. I am in.	|Troy Annie	|08
Yay!	|Annie Troy	|08
How about you, abed? It's tomorrow.	|Annie Abed	|08
Ooh, tomorrow? They're showing all four indiana joneses at the vista. I am really looking forward to the first three. I bought a whip.	|Abed Annie	|08
This is really important to me, abed. Could you please go as my friend? My really good friend?	|Annie Abed	|08
Wow, i didn't realize we were really good friends. I figured we were more like chandler and phoebe. They never really had stories together. Sure, i'll do it, chandler.	|Abed Annie	|08
Oh, thank you, abed.	|Annie Abed	|08
Oh!	|Shirley Abed	|08
I am gonna go save britta from that dude.	|Jeff Group	|08
Yeah, she looks like she's in trouble.	|Shirley Jeff	|08
Hope he doesn't try to "handsome" her to death.	|Shirley Group	|08
And panda has no pants.	|Vaughn Britta	|09
Hey.	|Jeff Britta	|09
Hey, hi, what's up, man? I am vaughn.	|Vaughn Jeff	|09
You in line?	|Jeff Vaughn	|09
Oh, no, no, no. We're just, uh, we're just chillin'. Hey, you're not gonna order coffee?	|Vaughn Jeff	|09
Oh, no, i was just gonna see if britta--	|Jeff Vaughn	|09
Hey, no judgment, bro. I used to do coffee. Then i made the switch to green tea. It's, like--It's, like, Filled with these antioxidants and stuff.	|Vaughn Jeff	|09
Hmm.	|Jeff Vaughn	|09
It's pretty tight.	|Vaughn Jeff	|09
Tight. Yes. I've heard that about green tea.	|Jeff Vaughn	|09
I like green tea. I should make the change.	|Britta Vaughn	|09
Up top, sugar bear.	|Vaughn Britta	|09
Yeah, give me some of that.	|Jeff Vaughn	|09
There it is.	|Vaughn Jeff	|09
Small coffee, please.	|Jeff Extra	|09
Britta's making the change to green tea.	|Pierce Group	|09
Oh, that's good. It's good for your skin.	|Shirley Group	|09
Welcome, research assistants. If you turn your attention to the monitor, You will see that our subjects Are waiting for the experiment to begin, but... It's actually happening right now.	|Duncan All	|10
Wow.	|All Duncan	|10
You see, the waiting is the experiment. The duncan principle is simple. Namely, that the more control lost by the-- Yeah, i'm gonna write this down too, actually. That's a good point. The more control lost by the ego, The more gained by the id, Resulting in a surprisingly predictable Emotional eruption or breaking point, Known to ma and pa as a good old-Fashioned tantrum. Oh.	|Duncan All	|10
Annie, why don't you, uh, go and tell our subjects That we're going to be starting the experiment In five minutes, okay? And annie... It's never actually going to start.	|Duncan Annie	|10
Ho ho.	|Garrett All	|10
Let's do this.	|Duncan All	|10
Hi, everyone.	|Annie All	|11
Hi, troy.	|Annie Troy	|11
Hi, abed. Hi.	|Troy Annie	|11
Hi, senor chang.	|Annie Chang	|11
What, a community college spanish teacher Can't use 80 bucks?	|Chang Annie	|11
Well, we're just running a little bit behind, So we'll probably start in about five minutes.	|Annie Chang	|11
No, no, no! No, no, no, no, no! It's unacceptable, all right? You lied to me! When you say something starts at 9:00, It starts at nueve!	|Chang Annie	|11
No! No!	|Chang All	|11
Houston, we have an idiot.	|Duncan All	|11
Did you know we walk the same way after class? I am sure you didn't or else we would've been walking together, Unless you're a jerk. Just kidding.	|Shirley Jeff	|12
Let's do it.	|Jeff Shirley	|12
Mm-Hmm. Don't go too fast for these dogs. Short legs. So how do you like--	|Shirley Jeff	|12
So you've got a kid, right?	|Jeff Shirley	|12
What's that?	|Shirley Jeff	|12
Nothing.	|Jeff Shirley	|12
So pierce isn't exactly right in the head, is he?	|Shirley Jeff	|12
I know a lot of grown men With radar dishes coming out of their ear.	|Jeff Shirley	|12
he's like inspector gadget.	|Shirley Jeff	|12
Yeah, go, go, gadget incontinence.	|Jeff Shirley	|12
And how about that guy that's always around, flirting with britta?	|Shirley Jeff	|12
I know! He's the worst! Vaughn?	|Jeff Shirley	|12
I know, and what is it with his hair?	|Shirley Jeff	|12
It's perpetually moist.	|Jeff Shirley	|12
Okay, we're three hours in, so let's review what we've seen. And pay close attention to every subject's breaking point. We've got a shouter. That one's a stomper. Bye, hippie. There's a generic whack job, bouncing up and down Like a six-Foot child. Shaking. Write that down. Visible shakes. Look at the little one chase the big one. Look at him go. I am gonna make him go quicker. It's like benny hill looks. Whoo, ooh, ooh, get him. Come back again. Whoo, ooh, ooh, get him. All right? There's a bit of fun. It lightens the mood. And back to the present. And then there were two. Break.	|Duncan All	|13
No, no, no! Annie! What is going on in there? Why--? What is taking so long? I've wasted all day here for you. The soul train awards were tonight. You promised butt stuff!	|Troy Annie	|14
And he's out. We got him. strike three. You're gone.	|Duncan All	|14
There's so much dust in here.	|Troy	|14
Do you know what? The longer they wait, the harder they break. Buckle up, students.	|Duncan All	|14
Do you see how often hacky sack takes his shirt off? He'd play shirts and skins in a game of checkers.	|Shirley Jeff	|15
I am so glad to be able to talk to someone about this. I wanted to say something to britta about it, But we're supposed to be friends now, And she'd think i was jealous.	|Jeff Shirley	|15
I don't see why you and britta aren't together. Two cute white people, going to school together, Just seems right.	|Shirley Jeff	|15
Shirley, we're not pandas in a zoo.	|Jeff Shirley	|15
Oh. Oh, dear.	|Shirley Jeff	|15
That is not what i want to see.	|Jeff Shirley	|15
There goes the shirt.	|Shirley Jeff	|15
Hey.	|Britta Jeff	|16
Hey, i'm fine. How are-- Want me to, uh, Want me to check you for grass stains?	|Jeff Britta	|16
I wasn't sure how or when to bring up That i was hanging out with vaughn. I figured that you'd make fun of him...and me.	|Britta Jeff	|16
Uh, first of all, Friends do not make fun of each other, Even if they're being tackled in the quad by a hippie, And secondly, vaughn seems cool.	|Jeff Britta	|16
Well, you guys should hang out sometime. I gotta go. I--Uh, that was tacky out there. You won't ever see that again.	|Britta Jeff	|16
Oh, no worries, brah.	|Jeff Britta	|16
Shirley, did you see senor chang's socks today? Tiny bullfighters.	|Jeff Shirley	|17
I can top that. Did you see that hacky sack wears an anklet? Since when won't you talk about vaughn?	|Shirley Jeff	|17
Look, i'm trying to be a good friend to britta. She thought i was gonna make fun of him, But i want to be unpredictable. I am gonna show her that i am not the jerk she thinks i am And friend the hell out of That green-Tea-Drinking drum circler.	|Jeff Shirley	|17
Okay, but tell me you've noticed How small his nipples are.	|Shirley Jeff	|17
Not engaging.	|Jeff Shirley	|17
What? It's not gossip when it's fact. My kids have got hamsters with bigger nips.	|Shirley Jeff	|17
No!	|Jeff Shirley	|17
Oh, well.	|Shirley Jeff	|17
No!	|Jeff Shirley	|17
Jeff!	|Shirley Jeff	|17

I am sorry, but this guy's not moving. I have classes to go to.	|Garrett Duncan	|18
Go! Fine! Go kill john lennon again, you loser.	|Duncan Garrett	|18
He's ruined my study! He has--He has warped the duncan principle. Damn you, you outlying piece of datum! ow! Aah!	|Duncan	|18
It's you! It's your fault!	|Duncan Annie	|18
But you told me to bring subjects.	|Annie Duncan	|18
Yeah, subjects! Not rain man! I should never have let you into this lab, Miss annie fanny panties in a bunch!	|Duncan Annie	|18
Oh! Oh, that's so hilarious! Did you think of that The last time you skipped a trip to the dentist?	|Annie Duncan	|18
Oh, let me answer that question with another question.	|Duncan Annie	|18
It's not--It's not fair! It's not fair! Why, why, why? What are you doing? Put your-- Stop writing! Put your pen-- Give me that! Get out! Get out, you dorks! Get out!	|Duncan All	|18
You have destroyed the duncan principle!	|Duncan Annie	|18
Go home!	|Annie Abed	|19
Cool. See ya.	|Abed Annie	|19
So britta said that you did a lot of community service.	|Jeff Vaughn	|20

Oh, that's nice.	|Shirley Vaughn	|21
You know, people underestimate the elderly, You know, but you see these guys out there And they're throwing the bee And they're just loving life. It's just inspiring.	|Vaughn Jeff Shirley	|21
You know, i'm gonna really-- I am gonna think about it.	|Jeff Vaughn	|21
All right. I am gonna go check on britts. See ya.	|Vaughn Jeff Shirley	|21
See ya.	|Shirley Vaughn	|21

I have a question for you. You like vaughn, right?	|Britta Jeff	|23
Oh, he--He's very cute.	|Jeff Britta	|23
I am just worried That he's thinking a little bit more intensely About this thing than i am. He says stuff, you know, after...	|Britta Jeff	|23
School?	|Jeff Britta	|23
After...	|Britta Jeff	|23
Dinner mints?	|Jeff Britta	|23
After...	|Britta Jeff	|23
Not having sex?	|Jeff Britta	|23
Ahh...	|Britta Jeff	|23
How was that?	|Jeff Britta	|23
What? Forget that. The problem right now is that he's calling me "babe." He's trying to hold my hand. It's getting a little relationship-Y. And he gave me something.	|Britta Jeff	|23
Herpes?	|Jeff Britta	|23
No. This.	|Britta Jeff	|23
A poem?	|Jeff Britta	|23
How do i respond to something like that? "Thank you"?	|Britta Jeff	|23
Well, it's a very good question. And it's one i will answer. Uh-- Ooh, i'm getting a text. I am just gonna read it, if you don't mind. I am reading it, and it is read.	|Jeff Britta	|23
"Did you ever notice where the ocean meets the sky, did ya? It's the same wizard blue that i see in your eye, brit-Ta."	|Jeff Shirley	|24
Oh, no, no. "Wizard blue"?	|Shirley Jeff	|24
Yeah.	|Jeff Shirley	|24
Thank you so much. You just brightened my day. I am so glad we can rip on that dude again.	|Shirley Jeff	|24
Look at this, look at this. That is the stain of a teardrop over the word "rad."	|Jeff Shirley	|24
Oh, he said "rad"? I thought he said "bad." Oh, that makes it worse.	|Shirley Jeff	|24
I am surprised he can read.	|Jeff Shirley	|24
Oh!	|Shirley Jeff	|24
You know?	|Jeff Shirley	|24
I know.	|Shirley Jeff	|24
Hey, sorry about bailing on the psych experiment.	|Troy Annie	|25
That was the experiment, troy. We were testing to see how long people would wait in the room.	|Annie Troy	|25
Whoa.	|Troy	|25
Oh, gotcha.	|Abed Annie	|25
"Gotcha"? That's all you have to say?	|Annie Abed	|25
Yeah.	|Abed Annie	|25
You sat in a room for 26 straight hours. Didn't that bother you?	|Annie Abed	|25
Yeah, i was livid.	|Abed Annie	|25
Then why didn't you leave?	|Annie Abed	|25
Because you asked me to stay and you said we were friends.	|Abed Annie	|25
Wait. Is this still part of the experiment?	|Troy Annie	|25
He's more like a puppy with a fish mouth.	|Jeff Shirley	|26
Right, right. It's more like this.	|Shirley Jeff	|26
That's right. Laugh it up. You guys want to know what they're doing?	|Pierce Group	|27
Yeah.	|Abed Pierce	|27

Making fun of all of us.	|Pierce Group	|27
I heard you with my own ear...noculars.	|Pierce Jeff	|27
Pierce, we are not making fun of you.	|Jeff Pierce	|27
Uh-Huh. Calling me "hacky sack" And ripping my--My six pack abs and my moist hair.	|Pierce Annie	|27
And that face you made? Well, i think it's pretty obviously annie.	|Pierce Shirley	|27
Okay, this is definitely still part of the experiment.	|Troy	|27
Pierce, we were not making fun of you.	|Jeff Pierce	|27
Yeah.	|Shirley Pierce	|27
We're making fun britta's boyfriend, vaughn.	|Jeff Pierce	|27
Oh, good. Well, in that case. But if we're gonna do something, let's do it as a team. I will get the ball rolling. Maybe he has a tiny penis.	|Pierce Jeff Shirley	|27
Who is this guy?	|Troy Group	|27
You all have got to see him. Everything's all, "no worries, no worries." And he always says hello three times in a row. Hello, good evening, how are you? And--Here, look! He wrote a poem!	|Shirley Group	|27
Oh!	|Group	|27

I can't believe you.	|Britta Jeff	|28
Honestly, jeff, how dare you?	|Shirley Jeff	|28
He's crying. Now he's barking.	|Pierce Group	|28

Britta is never gonna forgive me. I can't believe i showed you that poem. Oh, my god, my life is degrassi high.	|Jeff Shirley	|29
Oh, jeff. I have a gossip problem. I stir the pot, jeff. I am a pot stirrer. This isn't even the only study group i've had this year. You see those ladies over there? I used to be in their group till they kicked me out. They call me "tattle-Ina." It's a bumblebee nickname. It's--It's cute, but it stings.	|Shirley Jeff	|29
Hey, look at the size of that woman's earrings. It's like little dogs should be jumping through them.	|Jeff Shirley	|29
Mmmmmmm!	|Shirley Jeff	|29
This is never going to work.	|Shirley Jeff	|29
Look at them.	|Jeff Shirley	|29
This has to end. Mm-Mm, mm-Mm.	|Shirley Jeff	|29
Shirley, don't do this. Look, we can still hang out. It's just, you know, we won't bag on people.	|Jeff Shirley	|29
Come on, jeff. What are we gonna talk about? My kids? Your--Your doctor career?	|Shirley Jeff	|29
I was a lawyer.	|Jeff Shirley	|29
See? I am already bored.	|Shirley Jeff	|29
Well, we'll always have "tiny nipples."	|Jeff Shirley	|29
they were tiny. Okay. Jeff, wait. Wait. I know i shouldn't do this, But one last little piece of gossip. Britta told me she had a sex dream about you. You still have a chance.	|Shirley Jeff	|29
mm-Hmm. Mm-Mm.	|Shirley Jeff	|29

Mmmmmm! Mm-Mmm.	|Shirley Jeff	|29

I do not want to talk to you.	|Britta Jeff	|31
No, i know, and i'm sorry. I am really sorry. I am really, really sorry, And i will go talk to vaughn if you want me to.	|Jeff Britta	|31

Oh. Oh.	|Jeff Britta	|31
You broke my trust. You suck.	|Britta Jeff	|31
I know, and i'm sorry, But i was in a tough position. I couldn't handle just being one of the girls.	|Jeff Britta	|31
What do you want to be?	|Britta Jeff	|31
Is there a spot on the friendship spectrum Between total stranger And having to hear about the guys you date? And ideally, just a notch underneath Driving you to the airport and painting your kitchen?	|Jeff Britta	|31
How about the friend level Where you sometimes have to cat-Sit?	|Britta Jeff	|31
Done. And if i'm occasionally naked in your dreams, I won't complain.	|Jeff Britta	|31
Shirley.	|Britta Shirley	|31
I know. She's got a problem. She stirs the pot. She's a pot stirrer.	|Jeff Britta	|31
Sorry, dudes.	|Vaughan Extra	|32
No worries, man.	|Extra Vaughan	|32

Oh, no.	|Jeff	|35
Pierce! Pierce, give me your ear-Thing.	|Jeff Pierce	|35
Got rid of it. You see, jeff, there are certain things Man was not meant to hear. We were designed, by whatever entity you choose, To hear what's in this range, And really, this range alone. Because you know who's talking to us in this range? The people we love.	|Pierce Jeff	|35
He must have heard us call him inspector gadget.	|Jeff	|35
[Imitates a stoner] Oh, i think it's time For burning man.	|Abed Troy	|36
[Dorky voice] Ew, i'm saddam hussein. Ew.	|Troy Abed	|36

		Got rid of it. You see, jeff, there are certain things Man was not meant to hear. We were designed, by whatever entity you choose, To hear what's in this range, And really, this range alone. Because you know who's talking to us in this range? The people we love.

	troy

		No, no, no, no, no. This is my cell phone headset. And this is ear-Noculars. It's for spies and whatnot. It gives you sonic hearing.

	annie

		Uh-Huh. Calling me "hacky sack" And ripping my--My six pack abs and my moist hair.

	shirley

		And that face you made? Well, i think it's pretty obviously annie.

		Oh, good. Well, in that case. But if we're gonna do something, let's do it as a team. I will get the ball rolling. Maybe he has a tiny penis.

	vaughan

		Here, read it.



Speaker: group

	self

		Oh!



Speaker: all

	duncan

		Wow.



Speaker: jeff

	pierce

		She's behind you. Not interested.

		Pierce, we are not making fun of you.

		Pierce, we were not making fun of you.

		We're making fun britta's boyfriend, vaughn.

		Pierce! Pierce, give me your ear-Thing.

	group

		I am gonna go save britta from that dude.

	extra

		Small coffee, please.

	self

		Whoa. Shirley would have said something funny about that guy.

		Oh, no.

		He must have heard us call him inspector gadget.

	troy

		I am not 40. I can hear you through the window, morons.

	abed

		I am not 40. I can hear you through the window, morons.

	britta

		Yeah. I forgot to stagger the timing of my exit with shirley's. We both have a class across campus, and i can't go That kind of distance with "ooh, that's nice."

		No. that's not nice.

		Yeah, but i'm a sprinter. I am at my best during high-Speed bursts of wit. On a shirley walk, i'd be winded by that stoner tree.

		Interesting. 'Cause i might be worried If i was playing hacky sack a decade too late.

		All right, but i just wanted to point out That we easily walked more than 100 yards With no awkward pauses, And that is the sign of a true friend.

		There's the awkward pause.

		Hey.

		Hey, i'm fine. How are-- Want me to, uh, Want me to check you for grass stains?

		Uh, first of all, Friends do not make fun of each other, Even if they're being tackled in the quad by a hippie, And secondly, vaughn seems cool.

		Oh, no worries, brah.

		Oh, i'm good.

		Where do we go on saturdays? You said sunday.

		Oh, he--He's very cute.

		School?

		Dinner mints?

		Not having sex?

		How was that?

		Herpes?

		A poem?

		Well, it's a very good question. And it's one i will answer. Uh-- Ooh, i'm getting a text. I am just gonna read it, if you don't mind. I am reading it, and it is read.

		No, i know, and i'm sorry. I am really sorry. I am really, really sorry, And i will go talk to vaughn if you want me to.

		Oh. Oh.

		I know, and i'm sorry, But i was in a tough position. I couldn't handle just being one of the girls.

		Is there a spot on the friendship spectrum Between total stranger And having to hear about the guys you date? And ideally, just a notch underneath Driving you to the airport and painting your kitchen?

		Done. And if i'm occasionally naked in your dreams, I won't complain.

		I know. She's got a problem. She stirs the pot. She's a pot stirrer.

	shirley

		Yeah. Shoot!

		Let's do it.

		So you've got a kid, right?

		Nothing.

		I know a lot of grown men With radar dishes coming out of their ear.

		Yeah, go, go, gadget incontinence.

		I know! He's the worst! Vaughn?

		It's perpetually moist.

		I am so glad to be able to talk to someone about this. I wanted to say something to britta about it, But we're supposed to be friends now, And she'd think i was jealous.

		Shirley, we're not pandas in a zoo.

		That is not what i want to see.

		Shirley, did you see senor chang's socks today? Tiny bullfighters.

		Look, i'm trying to be a good friend to britta. She thought i was gonna make fun of him, But i want to be unpredictable. I am gonna show her that i am not the jerk she thinks i am And friend the hell out of That green-Tea-Drinking drum circler.

		Not engaging.

		No!

		No!

		You are the devil.

		Donde vaughn ustedes los sabados?

		"Did you ever notice where the ocean meets the sky, did ya? It's the same wizard blue that i see in your eye, brit-Ta."

		Yeah.

		Look at this, look at this. That is the stain of a teardrop over the word "rad."

		I am surprised he can read.

		You know?

		He's more like a puppy with a fish mouth.

		We shouldn't show that.

		Britta is never gonna forgive me. I can't believe i showed you that poem. Oh, my god, my life is degrassi high.

		Hey, look at the size of that woman's earrings. It's like little dogs should be jumping through them.

		Look at them.

		Shirley, don't do this. Look, we can still hang out. It's just, you know, we won't bag on people.

		I was a lawyer.

		Well, we'll always have "tiny nipples."

		Details.

		Details!

		Details!

	vaughn

		You in line?

		Oh, no, i was just gonna see if britta--

		Hmm.

		Tight. Yes. I've heard that about green tea.

		Yeah, give me some of that.

		So britta said that you did a lot of community service.

		And what makes frisbee ultimate?

		You know, i'm gonna really-- I am gonna think about it.



Speaker: garrett

	all

		Ho ho.

	duncan

		Professor.

		I am sorry, but this guy's not moving. I have classes to go to.



Speaker: duncan

	all

		Welcome, research assistants. If you turn your attention to the monitor, You will see that our subjects Are waiting for the experiment to begin, but... It's actually happening right now.

		You see, the waiting is the experiment. The duncan principle is simple. Namely, that the more control lost by the-- Yeah, i'm gonna write this down too, actually. That's a good point. The more control lost by the ego, The more gained by the id, Resulting in a surprisingly predictable Emotional eruption or breaking point, Known to ma and pa as a good old-Fashioned tantrum. Oh.

		Let's do this.

		Houston, we have an idiot.

		Okay, we're three hours in, so let's review what we've seen. And pay close attention to every subject's breaking point. We've got a shouter. That one's a stomper. Bye, hippie. There's a generic whack job, bouncing up and down Like a six-Foot child. Shaking. Write that down. Visible shakes. Look at the little one chase the big one. Look at him go. I am gonna make him go quicker. It's like benny hill looks. Whoo, ooh, ooh, get him. Come back again. Whoo, ooh, ooh, get him. All right? There's a bit of fun. It lightens the mood. And back to the present. And then there were two. Break.

		And he's out. We got him. strike three. You're gone.

		Do you know what? The longer they wait, the harder they break. Buckle up, students.

		It's not--It's not fair! It's not fair! Why, why, why? What are you doing? Put your-- Stop writing! Put your pen-- Give me that! Get out! Get out, you dorks! Get out!

	self

		Oh, my... Why won't he leave?

		He's ruined my study! He has--He has warped the duncan principle. Damn you, you outlying piece of datum! ow! Aah!

	annie

		What?

		Hello.

		Ah. The duncan principle.

		Right.

		Okay, i've actually been in this situation many times, So i'm just going to be up front. I am not allowed to date students.

		Even though you're an eight.

		Which is a british ten, So i'm angry.

		But if, in spite of that, you are still interested, Then you may join the lab. Ah! Okay. You need to bring two human subjects. And it would not hurt your chances one bit If you could lend me a fiver. I seem to have left my purse in my duffle And my duffle in the boot of my lorry, so--

		Annie, why don't you, uh, go and tell our subjects That we're going to be starting the experiment In five minutes, okay? And annie... It's never actually going to start.

		Is it on pause?

		It's you! It's your fault!

		Yeah, subjects! Not rain man! I should never have let you into this lab, Miss annie fanny panties in a bunch!

		Oh, let me answer that question with another question.

		You have destroyed the duncan principle!

	garrett

		What?

		Go! Fine! Go kill john lennon again, you loser.

		Please? You get paid.

	duncan

		Professor duncan! Professor duncan!

		Excuse me. Annie edison. I am in your 101 lecture.

		I've heard about your special psych lab.

		Yes. And i know it's limited to second-Year students, But i had a 4.0 at riverside high, And i'm not looking down on this school at all, But i'm only here because of a brief addiction to pills That i was told would help me...focus, But they actually made me lose my scholarship and virginity. So--

		If you would let me take your lab early, It would be a real feather in my transcript.

		Oh!

		Oh!

		Oh!

		Oh.

		No, that's just him.

		But you told me to bring subjects.

		Oh! Oh, that's so hilarious! Did you think of that The last time you skipped a trip to the dentist?

	extra

		Excuse me. Oh, sorry, ladies.

	abed

		How about you, abed? It's tomorrow.

		This is really important to me, abed. Could you please go as my friend? My really good friend?

		Oh, thank you, abed.

		Sorry you've been waiting 26 hours. It's just gonna be another five minutes.

		Go home!

		"Gotcha"? That's all you have to say?

		You sat in a room for 26 straight hours. Didn't that bother you?

		Then why didn't you leave?

		Abed, here. I wanted to say sorry for yelling at you.

		I just got the first three because... the fourth one blows.

	troy

		No.

		No.

		Yay!

		Hi, troy.

		That was the experiment, troy. We were testing to see how long people would wait in the room.

	chang

		Hi, senor chang.

		Well, we're just running a little bit behind, So we'll probably start in about five minutes.



Speaker: britta

	vaughan

		So i'll be done in, like, an hour.

		No.

	shirley

		Shirley.

		Shh shh shh shh.

	vaughn

		Hey, vaughn, how's it going?

		I never even knew that's what asexual meant.

		I like green tea. I should make the change.

		I am gonna get dessert. Want anything?

	group

		Guys, you've met vaughn, right?

	jeff

		You forget something?

		That's mean.

		I find shirley very easy to talk to, And besides, aren't you supposed to have, Like, an olympic gold medal in jibber-Jabber?

		My class is that way.

		I am really glad that you're not hitting on me anymore.

		Hey.

		I wasn't sure how or when to bring up That i was hanging out with vaughn. I figured that you'd make fun of him...and me.

		Well, you guys should hang out sometime. I gotta go. I--Uh, that was tacky out there. You won't ever see that again.

		I am gonna get dessert. Want anything?

		Domingo, pl-- Oh, okay, I--

		I have a question for you. You like vaughn, right?

		I am just worried That he's thinking a little bit more intensely About this thing than i am. He says stuff, you know, after...

		After...

		After...

		Ahh...

		What? Forget that. The problem right now is that he's calling me "babe." He's trying to hold my hand. It's getting a little relationship-Y. And he gave me something.

		No. This.

		How do i respond to something like that? "Thank you"?

		I can't believe you.

		I do not want to talk to you.

		Vaughan broke up with me.

		You broke my trust. You suck.

		What do you want to be?

		How about the friend level Where you sometimes have to cat-Sit?



Speaker: shirley

	pierce

		You brought your mail to campus?

		Yeah.

	group

		Hope he doesn't try to "handsome" her to death.

		Oh, that's good. It's good for your skin.

		You all have got to see him. Everything's all, "no worries, no worries." And he always says hello three times in a row. Hello, good evening, how are you? And--Here, look! He wrote a poem!

	jeff

		Nice day out today, isn't it?

		Yeah, she looks like she's in trouble.

		Did you know we walk the same way after class? I am sure you didn't or else we would've been walking together, Unless you're a jerk. Just kidding.

		Mm-Hmm. Don't go too fast for these dogs. Short legs. So how do you like--

		What's that?

		So pierce isn't exactly right in the head, is he?

		he's like inspector gadget.

		And how about that guy that's always around, flirting with britta?

		I know, and what is it with his hair?

		Do you see how often hacky sack takes his shirt off? He'd play shirts and skins in a game of checkers.

		I don't see why you and britta aren't together. Two cute white people, going to school together, Just seems right.

		Oh. Oh, dear.

		There goes the shirt.

		I can top that. Did you see that hacky sack wears an anklet? Since when won't you talk about vaughn?

		Okay, but tell me you've noticed How small his nipples are.

		What? It's not gossip when it's fact. My kids have got hamsters with bigger nips.

		Oh, well.

		Jeff!

		Hey, you two.

		I know.

		Oh, no, no. "Wizard blue"?

		Thank you so much. You just brightened my day. I am so glad we can rip on that dude again.

		Oh, he said "rad"? I thought he said "bad." Oh, that makes it worse.

		Oh!

		I know.

		Right, right. It's more like this.

		Oh, no, it's fine.

		Honestly, jeff, how dare you?

		Jeff, wait! I am sorry i sold you out.

		Oh, jeff. I have a gossip problem. I stir the pot, jeff. I am a pot stirrer. This isn't even the only study group i've had this year. You see those ladies over there? I used to be in their group till they kicked me out. They call me "tattle-Ina." It's a bumblebee nickname. It's--It's cute, but it stings.

		Mmmmmmm!

		This is never going to work.

		This has to end. Mm-Mm, mm-Mm.

		Come on, jeff. What are we gonna talk about? My kids? Your--Your doctor career?

		See? I am already bored.

		they were tiny. Okay. Jeff, wait. Wait. I know i shouldn't do this, But one last little piece of gossip. Britta told me she had a sex dream about you. You still have a chance.

		mm-Hmm. Mm-Mm.

		Mmmmmm! Mm-Mmm.

		Mm-Mmm!

		and so i told him... Oh, hey--Hey, jeff.

	abed

		Oh!

	vaughn

		Hey, you two.

		Well, that's a cool shirt.

		Where's it from?

		Oh, that's nice.

		See ya.

	vaughan

		No.

And this particular coward Dots her is with tiny, Itty-Bitty, little circles. Boop. Boop. Tcch! Isn't that precious and cute? Who's "erratic and unstable" now, Princess Gringa?

		What, a community college spanish teacher Can't use 80 bucks?

		No, no, no! No, no, no, no, no! It's unacceptable, all right? You lied to me! When you say something starts at 9:00, It starts at nueve!



Speaker: vaughn

	jeff

		Hey, hi, what's up, man? I am vaughn.

	Speaker: duncan	Listeners: all
Welcome, research assistants. If you turn your attention to the monitor, You will see that our subjects Are waiting for the experiment to begin, but... It's actually happening right now.
	Speaker: all	Listeners: duncan
Wow.
	Speaker: duncan	Listeners: all
You see, the waiting is the experiment. The duncan principle is simple. Namely, that the more control lost by the-- Yeah, i'm gonna write this down too, actually. That's a good point. The more control lost by the ego, The more gained by the id, Resulting in a surprisingly predictable Emotional eruption or breaking point, Known to ma and pa as a good old-Fashioned tantrum. Oh.
	Speaker: duncan	Listeners: annie
Annie, why don't you, uh, go and tell our subjects That we're going to be starting the experiment In five minutes, okay? And annie... It's never actually going to start.

	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: shirley
I am so glad to be able to talk to someone about this. I wanted to say something to britta about it, But we're supposed to be friends now, And she'd think i was jealous.
	Speaker: shirley	Listeners: jeff

	Speaker: britta	Listeners: jeff
What do you want to be?
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: britta
Is there a spot on the friendship spectrum Between total stranger And having to hear about the guys you date? And ideally, just a notch underneath Driving you to the airport and painting your kitchen?
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: jeff
How about the friend level Where you sometimes have to cat-Sit?
	Speaker: jeff	Listeners: britta
Done. And if i'm occasionally naked in your dreams, I won't complain.
	Speaker: britta	Listeners: shirley
Shirley.
