1
00:00:00,701 --> 00:00:03,131
Good afternoon,
Greendale community college.

2
00:00:03,256 --> 00:00:07,137
I am your dean with a few corrections
to the fall class catalog.

3
00:00:07,566 --> 00:00:10,200
Cosmology should be cosmetology,

4
00:00:10,529 --> 00:00:12,529
astrology should be astronomy,

5
00:00:12,828 --> 00:00:15,097
and the students on the cover
should be smiling,

6
00:00:15,265 --> 00:00:16,955
but I suppose that's a matter of opinion.

7
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:20,711
Whoever is growing a small patch of cannabis
behind the gymnasium,

8
00:00:21,198 --> 00:00:23,614
congratulations.
You have won a cruise.

9
00:00:23,739 --> 00:00:25,650
Report to security
to claim your tickets.

10
00:00:26,865 --> 00:00:28,944
In order to increase
awareness of homelessness,

11
00:00:29,113 --> 00:00:31,009
security has been given binoculars.

12
00:00:31,556 --> 00:00:33,018
In campus news,

13
00:00:33,143 --> 00:00:35,993
the debate over our library's PA system
continues

14
00:00:36,118 --> 00:00:38,954
with some students
suggesting its volume be lowered,

15
00:00:39,218 --> 00:00:41,411
while others
question its very purpose.

16
00:00:41,536 --> 00:00:43,780
More on that story as it unfolds.	|Dean

17
00:00:44,379 --> 00:00:46,587
- That dude makes a lot of announcements.	|Troy Group
- I like it,

18
00:00:46,834 --> 00:00:49,173
it makes every ten minutes
feel like the beginning of a new scene of a tv show.

19
00:00:49,881 --> 00:00:52,944
Of course, the illusion only lasts until someone says
something they'd never say on tv

20
00:00:53,069 --> 00:00:55,388
like, how much their life is like tv.
There, it's gone.	|Abed Group

21
00:00:55,566 --> 00:00:57,390
I guess Jeff's running late again.	|Annie Group

22
00:00:57,558 --> 00:00:59,350
Oh, What a shame.
Maybe we should get started...	|Britta Group

23
00:01:00,222 --> 00:01:02,353
I think we should wait for Jeff
before we start studying.	|Shirley Group

24
00:01:04,770 --> 00:01:06,095
But maybe when Jeff gets here,

25
00:01:06,220 --> 00:01:08,275
we could talk to him as a group
about his tardiness.	|Annie Britta

26
00:01:09,063 --> 00:01:10,611
Don't use that word around Abed.

27
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:14,253
In any case, if you want me to have a chat with Jeff,
I'd be happy to do it.

28
00:01:14,378 --> 00:01:17,066
We've got a bond going, kind of.
Sorta like brothers.	|Pierce Group

29
00:01:17,369 --> 00:01:20,287
I hope your mom didn't make you take baths together
'cause one of you would've been like, 30.	|Troy Pierce

30
00:01:20,667 --> 00:01:21,664
That's funny.

31
00:01:21,832 --> 00:01:24,961
You know, Jeff probably comes late
so he doesn't have to sit through all of your tardiness.	|Pierce Troy

32
00:01:25,689 --> 00:01:26,689
Sorry, Abed.	|Pierce Abed

33
00:01:28,356 --> 00:01:30,190
Will you guys have some self-respect?

34
00:01:30,315 --> 00:01:33,092
You're obsessing over someone
who does not give you a second thought.

35
00:01:33,698 --> 00:01:37,012
Meanwhile, in Guatemala, journalists are being killed
by their own government.	|Britta Group

36
00:01:37,181 --> 00:01:39,014
Baby, you, uh, jumped a column there.
What's happening in Guatemala?	|Shirley Britta

37
00:01:39,816 --> 00:01:42,435
- Nothing.	|Britta Shirley
- Journalists are being murdered?	|Annie Britta

38
00:01:43,354 --> 00:01:46,748
Believe me, every day in that country,
people are being killed for speaking out.

39
00:01:46,873 --> 00:01:48,733
and the worst part of it is,
when it's all over...	|Britta Annie Shirley

40
00:01:49,006 --> 00:01:51,193
- Spoilers.	|Abed Britta
- It's gonna be as if it never even happened.	|Britta Annie Shirley

41
00:01:53,690 --> 00:01:56,519
Real stories...
They don't have spoilers.

42
00:01:56,644 --> 00:01:59,493
You understand that TV and life
are different, right?	|Britta Annie

43
00:02:04,027 --> 00:02:05,708
- My Lady.	|Jeff Annie
- My Lord.	|Annie Jeff

44
00:02:06,774 --> 00:02:08,457
- Hey, Baby.	|Jeff Shirley
- Hi, Sweetie.	|Shirley Jeff

45
00:02:08,582 --> 00:02:10,946
- You smell nice. Vitamin P.	|Jeff Pierce
- Morning, Jeffrey.

46
00:02:11,323 --> 00:02:13,039
People were jazzed to see me too.	|Pierce Jeff

47
00:02:13,164 --> 00:02:14,956
- Word 'em up.	|Troy Jeff
- Word 'em everywhere.	|Jeff Troy

48
00:02:15,081 --> 00:02:17,172
- Good entrance.	|Abed Jeff
- That was for you.	|Jeff Abed

49
00:02:24,843 --> 00:02:27,438
I think there's something that the 
 group would like to talk to you about.	|Britta Jeff

50
00:02:27,606 --> 00:02:29,506
Actually, there's nothing...	|Abed Jeff

51
00:02:31,143 --> 00:02:34,181
If you're gonna study with people,
it would be cool of you to show up on time.	|Britta Jeff

52
00:02:34,306 --> 00:02:35,756
Oh. Were you waiting?

53
00:02:39,602 --> 00:02:43,324
talking about your interesting personal lives
and your cool emotional problems.

54
00:02:44,189 --> 00:02:45,956
I just feel like I never
have anything to offer.

55
00:02:47,530 --> 00:02:51,220
Truth is my life is emptier
than this three-ring binder.	|Jeff Group

56
00:02:51,866 --> 00:02:54,048
Annie, Do you have any Spanish notes
that might fit in there?

57
00:02:55,597 --> 00:02:57,051
Double-spaced. Thank you.	|Jeff Annie

58
00:02:57,657 --> 00:03:00,060
So what's a guy got to do
to get a "C" around here?	|Jeff Group

59
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:03,641
One-liner.	|Troy Group

60
00:03:33,330 --> 00:03:35,139
Good studying.
See you later. Bye.	|Abed Group

61
00:03:37,045 --> 00:03:38,482
You know what today is?

62
00:03:39,059 --> 00:03:41,512
The two-week anniversary
of my horrible first impression.	|Jeff Britta

63
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,597
- There's a card for that?	|Britta Jeff
- Not specifically,

64
00:03:43,765 --> 00:03:46,221
but if you think of grandsons
as a metaphor for friendship,

65
00:03:46,346 --> 00:03:48,594
I think you'll agree
with this transformer here

66
00:03:48,719 --> 00:03:50,746
that it's time for ours
to become a man.

67
00:03:50,871 --> 00:03:52,273
By reading from the Torah.	|Jeff Britta

68
00:03:52,739 --> 00:03:55,236
Look, Jeff. You're harmless enough to me
cause a life full of ups and downs

69
00:03:55,361 --> 00:03:58,860
has given me douche-ray vision,
but those are good people in there,

70
00:03:58,985 --> 00:04:02,241
and they trust and respect you.
Watching you exploit them, kinda bums me out.	|Britta Jeff

71
00:04:02,409 --> 00:04:05,669
- Exploit them? They're my friends.	|Jeff Britta
- You want me to bring your car around, Jeff?	|Abed Jeff

72
00:04:07,634 --> 00:04:09,918
No, Abed, I don't want you
to bring my car around.

73
00:04:10,043 --> 00:04:12,808
I'll bring yours around, good guy.
You get going, all right.	|Jeff Abed

74
00:04:13,657 --> 00:04:14,588
You're cute,

75
00:04:14,713 --> 00:04:17,923
but selfish and narcissistic
to the point of near delusion.	|Britta Jeff

76
00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:21,792
She said I was cute.	|Jeff Britta

77
00:04:21,917 --> 00:04:24,096
Tell you what, you take her.
I have less to prove.

78
00:04:24,561 --> 00:04:27,350
You can't pursue people
so desperately.

79
00:04:27,475 --> 00:04:29,105
It starts to creep them out.

80
00:04:29,668 --> 00:04:32,090
Why don't we go get a beer?
I'll give you some advice,

81
00:04:32,215 --> 00:04:34,690
and we can have what the 
kids are calling a sausage fest.	|Pierce Jeff

82
00:04:35,371 --> 00:04:38,360
I'm not much of a sausage guy, Pierce.
Maybe next time.	|Jeff Pierce

83
00:04:39,663 --> 00:04:40,963
Next time, then.	|Pierce Jeff

84
00:04:45,307 --> 00:04:48,743
- Will you tell us more about Guatemala?	|Annie Britta
- I never went to a real college.	|Shirley Britta

85
00:04:48,868 --> 00:04:51,502
You should discover that stuff
on your own.	|Britta Annie Shirley

86
00:04:51,627 --> 00:04:52,850
But we need your help.

87
00:04:52,975 --> 00:04:55,348
We've been living
on the wrong side of the looking glass.

88
00:04:55,473 --> 00:04:57,630
You're like Jodie Foster
or Susan Sarandon.

89
00:04:58,051 --> 00:05:01,383
- You'd rather keep it real than be likeable.	|Annie Britta
- Can you at least tell us what to google?	|Shirley Britta

90
00:05:01,552 --> 00:05:04,063
You could start
with this journalist Chacata-Panecos.

91
00:05:04,188 --> 00:05:07,671
He wrote an article critical
of the government, and they killed him.	|Britta Annie Shirley

92
00:05:07,796 --> 00:05:09,727
- That's horrible.	|Annie Britta
- Can we have a protest?

93
00:05:09,852 --> 00:05:12,322
- I want to protest the hell out of something.	|Shirley Britta
- We could have a candlelight vigil

94
00:05:12,447 --> 00:05:15,147
- like lesbians have on the news.	|Annie Shirley
- I could make brownies.	|Shirley Annie

95
00:05:17,057 --> 00:05:18,057
Brownies?	|Britta Shirley

96
00:05:18,917 --> 00:05:21,236
Every once in a while,
a student come up to me and ask,

97
00:05:21,894 --> 00:05:23,972
Why do you teach Spanish?"

98
00:05:27,733 --> 00:05:29,257
They say it just like that.

99
00:05:29,669 --> 00:05:31,288
"Why do you teach

100
00:05:31,601 --> 00:05:32,601
Spanish?"

101
00:05:34,048 --> 00:05:35,315
"Why you?"

102
00:05:37,728 --> 00:05:38,878
Why not math?

103
00:05:42,010 --> 00:05:44,019
Why not photography?

104
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:47,650
Why not martial arts?

105
00:05:48,998 --> 00:05:51,612
I mean, surely
it must be in my nature

106
00:05:51,737 --> 00:05:53,637
to instruct you in something

107
00:05:53,895 --> 00:05:55,729
that's ancient and secret

108
00:05:55,897 --> 00:05:58,357
like building a wall
that you can see from outer space.

109
00:05:59,307 --> 00:06:01,272
Well, I'll tell you 
why I teach Spanish.

110
00:06:01,397 --> 00:06:03,597
It is none of your business, okay?

111
00:06:03,926 --> 00:06:06,407
Now, I don't want to have
any conversations

112
00:06:06,576 --> 00:06:10,561
about what a mysterious
and inscrutable man I am.

113
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:18,085
I am a Spanish genius!

114
00:06:19,481 --> 00:06:21,484
In espanol, my nickname is

115
00:06:21,609 --> 00:06:23,772
"El tigre chino"!

116
00:06:27,225 --> 00:06:29,711
'Cause my knowledge
will bite her face off!

117
00:06:32,897 --> 00:06:36,040
So don't question Senor Chang
or you'll get bit.

118
00:06:37,522 --> 00:06:38,331
Ya bit.

119
00:06:38,774 --> 00:06:39,720
Ya bit!

120
00:06:45,139 --> 00:06:48,573
Friday Mañana, we'll be having conversations
with the rest of the class

121
00:06:48,698 --> 00:06:50,826
using some of the phrases
we learned in unit one.

122
00:06:51,288 --> 00:06:54,513
You'll be partnering up
in pairs of dos.

123
00:06:56,674 --> 00:06:58,083
If you look under your desk,

124
00:06:58,252 --> 00:07:00,878
you'll find a card with either a picture
or a word on it.

125
00:07:02,522 --> 00:07:04,533
For ejemplo, blondie aqui

126
00:07:04,658 --> 00:07:07,645
has a card
with a picture of a house on it.

127
00:07:07,770 --> 00:07:11,774
So that means the person with the card
with the word casa on it, is her partner.

128
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:14,349
Comprende, Star-burns?

129
00:07:17,594 --> 00:07:20,522
See you Friday.
Find your partners. Have a great day.

130
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:22,973
And what do we say
at the end of every class?

131
00:07:25,962 --> 00:07:28,210
Come on, hands...
90 percent of Spanish.	|Chang All

132
00:07:35,933 --> 00:07:37,498
You want to trade cards?

133
00:07:37,894 --> 00:07:39,427
- I'll give you 20 bucks.	|Jeff Abed
- No.	|Abed Jeff

134
00:07:41,804 --> 00:07:44,505
- 50 bucks.	|Jeff Abed
- I don't want your money. I want your shirt.	|Abed Jeff

135
00:07:45,269 --> 00:07:47,716
- What?	|Jeff Abed
- I've had my eye on it since registration day.	|Abed Jeff

136
00:07:48,957 --> 00:07:52,096
- All right, fine. Give me your card.	|Jeff Abed
-  I don't think you understand. I want to wear it out of here.	|Abed Jeff

137
00:07:56,333 --> 00:07:57,996
What are the odds?	|Jeff Britta

138
00:07:58,121 --> 00:08:00,311
Are you sure
you didn't adjust the odds?

139
00:08:00,436 --> 00:08:03,070
I know Abed's been eyeing that shirt
for three weeks.

140
00:08:03,195 --> 00:08:05,958
It's almost like you gave it to him
so he would switch cards.	|Britta Jeff

141
00:08:06,083 --> 00:08:09,139
I gave Abed my shirt
because I'm not selfish,

142
00:08:09,264 --> 00:08:12,990
which is something I guess you'll finally 
discover while we are working on this.

143
00:08:13,478 --> 00:08:15,432
Tomorrow night?
Dinner, drinks.	|Jeff Britta

144
00:08:15,557 --> 00:08:18,378
I think that's something
we should discuss with our partners.

145
00:08:19,091 --> 00:08:21,166
Oh, see, I did switch cards.	|Britta Jeff

146
00:08:24,807 --> 00:08:26,981
Can you believe this?
What are the odds?	|Pierce Jeff

147
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:30,480
-That's a nice shirt. Want to sell it?	|Pierce Jeff
-Yes.	|Jeff Pierce

148
00:08:33,176 --> 00:08:35,055
What's the moist towelette
industry like?

149
00:08:35,707 --> 00:08:37,822
Believe me,
it's nothing like the product.

150
00:08:38,207 --> 00:08:40,978
Nah. It's a hard, dry, large business.

151
00:08:41,342 --> 00:08:42,729
Destroyed all my marriages.

152
00:08:42,898 --> 00:08:46,066
- Of course it didn't help any that 
I can't have children. I'm not sterile.

153
00:08:46,269 --> 00:08:49,375
In fact, it's a rare condition
they call "hyper-virility".

154
00:08:50,194 --> 00:08:53,762
Apparently my sperm
shoot through the egg like bullets.

155
00:08:53,887 --> 00:08:55,767
- Can you believe that?	|Pierce Jeff
- I can't.

156
00:08:55,892 --> 00:08:57,411
But you can, so that's fine.

157
00:08:57,909 --> 00:08:59,192
So, the assignment is

158
00:08:59,317 --> 00:09:02,374
to,uh, write a Spanish conversation
using those five phrases.	|Jeff Pierce

159
00:09:04,712 --> 00:09:06,253
Hemingway's Lemonade.	|Pierce Jeff

160
00:09:07,393 --> 00:09:10,465
- We don't need to make this a long evening. We can just..	|Jeff Pierce
- Am I a piece of garbage to you?	|Pierce Jeff

161
00:09:11,267 --> 00:09:12,035
What? No!	|Jeff Pierce

162
00:09:15,979 --> 00:09:16,979
Got ya.

163
00:09:18,725 --> 00:09:20,613
Let's have one drink before we work.

164
00:09:27,409 --> 00:09:28,901
To the "empowerage" of words.	|Pierce Jeff

165
00:09:29,403 --> 00:09:31,403
To the irony of that sentence.	|Jeff Pierce

166
00:09:34,208 --> 00:09:37,075
So what's up with you, Jeffrey?
It seems like you got a burr up your ass or something.	|Pierce Jeff

167
00:09:40,270 --> 00:09:41,970
Well, I guess that it's...

168
00:09:42,095 --> 00:09:43,624
- I think it's Britta.	|Jeff Pierce
- Forget Britta.

169
00:09:43,869 --> 00:09:47,051
...you have to know is her name.
What is she, a water filter?

170
00:09:47,430 --> 00:09:48,378
She's ugly.	|Pierce Jeff

171
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:54,009
- Why don't we start with me saying...	|Jeff Pierce
- What are you doing?	|Pierce Jeff

172
00:09:55,445 --> 00:09:56,695
Our assignment.	|Jeff Pierce

173
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:01,016
Oh no no no. This is the first time people are gonna
see Winger and Hawthorne together.

174
00:10:01,184 --> 00:10:03,268
We are gonna show them
we're a force to be reckoned with.

175
00:10:03,607 --> 00:10:05,979
Come on,
let's brainstorm some story ideas.

176
00:10:08,529 --> 00:10:11,533
Better yet, before we do that,
let's ask ourselves...

177
00:10:13,924 --> 00:10:16,374
- What is a story?	|Pierce Jeff
- Oh, My God in heaven.	|Jeff Pierce

178
00:10:25,818 --> 00:10:28,210
If you like that brownie,
you'll gonna hate what's going up on in Guatemala.

179
00:10:28,655 --> 00:10:29,655
Google it.	|Shirley Extra

180
00:10:31,339 --> 00:10:32,404
Raise the truth.	|Shirley Britta

181
00:10:33,398 --> 00:10:34,519
Once it gets dark,

182
00:10:34,644 --> 00:10:37,427
I hand out the candles and we do 
what's called "a speechless protest".

183
00:10:37,766 --> 00:10:39,179
We put the tape over our mouths,

184
00:10:39,358 --> 00:10:42,432
and gather hand-in-hand
in a sea of outraged silence.	|Annie Britta

184.5
00:10:39,358 --> 00:10:42,432
Starburns, no.	|Britta Starburns

185
00:10:51,766 --> 00:10:54,069
- What's gotten into you?	|Annie Britta
- This is not how you do this.	|Britta Annie Shirley

186
00:10:54,237 --> 00:10:56,613
We know it's not how you do it
cause we're doing everything.	|Annie Britta

187
00:10:56,781 --> 00:10:58,431
But this is tacky and lame.

188
00:11:00,055 --> 00:11:01,303
I didn't mean that.

189
00:11:01,744 --> 00:11:02,744
I'm sorry.

190
00:11:02,936 --> 00:11:04,312
What I meant to say

191
00:11:04,437 --> 00:11:06,819
is that this cause
is really personal to me.	|Britta Annie Shirley

192
00:11:07,167 --> 00:11:10,460
Are you saying
that we're not allowed to protest?

193
00:11:12,369 --> 00:11:15,381
- Britta, you sound like Guatemala.	|Annie Britta
- Sounds like somebody has the case of

194
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:17,929
"likes to use French politics
to make themselves special,

195
00:11:18,054 --> 00:11:20,429
"but doesn't actually ever want to do
anything-itis."	|Shirley Britta

196
00:11:20,597 --> 00:11:21,697
-No. I do things.

197
00:11:22,774 --> 00:11:23,874
I went to...

198
00:11:26,253 --> 00:11:28,040
I don't do anything.

199
00:11:30,482 --> 00:11:31,565
What can I do?	|Britta Shirley Annie

200
00:11:33,532 --> 00:11:35,319
You can hang the Chacata-Panecos pinata.	|Annie Britta

201
00:11:35,899 --> 00:11:38,196
You guys realize
he was beaten to death, right?	|Britta Shirley Annie

202
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:40,138
That's where we got the idea from.	|Shirley Britta

203
00:11:40,263 --> 00:11:41,263
Poignant.	|Annie Shirley

204
00:11:47,813 --> 00:11:50,481
- Alright, tell me what I've got so far.	|Pierce Jeff
- What we have so far?

205
00:11:50,877 --> 00:11:53,465
We have something incredibly long,

206
00:11:53,590 --> 00:11:55,881
and very confusing,
and a little homophobic.

207
00:11:56,455 --> 00:11:58,298
And really, really, specifically,

208
00:11:58,423 --> 00:12:01,136
surprisingly,
and gratuitously critical of Israel.

209
00:12:01,798 --> 00:12:04,206
And it's called "two conquistadors",
should probably be "dos".

210
00:12:04,331 --> 00:12:05,989
I mean, it is a Spanish class.

211
00:12:06,114 --> 00:12:09,185
Oh, which reminds me,
the only thing not included in this epic

212
00:12:09,310 --> 00:12:12,689
are the five phrases required
to get me a passing grade.	|Jeff Pierce

213
00:12:14,267 --> 00:12:15,901
You're right.
Needs more work.	|Pierce Jeff

214
00:12:16,170 --> 00:12:18,320
- What are you guys doing?	|Abed Jeff Pierce
- I have no idea.	|Jeff Abed

215
00:12:18,704 --> 00:12:20,697
- Well, we're headed to the demonstration.	|Troy Jeff Pierce
- What, Hippies?	|Pierce Abed

216
00:12:20,866 --> 00:12:23,954
- Some cause Britta's into.	|Troy Pierce Jeff
- It's a silent protest. Lots of candles.

217
00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:26,638
Gets the ladies in the mood for social 
change. If you know what I mean.

218
00:12:26,763 --> 00:12:30,613
- Good chance to put some miles on this shirt.	|Abed Pierce Jeff
- You realize these conversations are due in the morning.

219
00:12:30,614 --> 00:12:31,614
 - Don't you?	|Pierce Troy Abed

220
00:12:32,978 --> 00:12:33,829
Right.

221
00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:37,323
What do you want to do?	|Troy Abed

221
00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:37,323
Hola, mi llamo Abed	|Abed Troy

221
00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:37,323
Hola, mi llamo Troy	|Troy Abed

221
00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:37,323
Donde esta la biblioteca?	|Abed Troy

221
00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:37,323
La biblioteca esta en la ciudad	|Troy Abed

221
00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:37,323
Gracias	|Abed Troy

222
00:12:47,642 --> 00:12:48,642
Hacks.	|Pierce Abed Troy

223
00:12:49,894 --> 00:12:52,646
Okay What do we do about the ending of act two?	|Pierce Jeff

224
00:12:53,023 --> 00:12:54,548
I'll tell you what we're gonna do.

225
00:12:54,979 --> 00:12:58,777
We're gonna take this, and we're gonna 
put it in a museum for crazy people.

226
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:01,080
And then we're gonna take this,

227
00:13:01,205 --> 00:13:05,020
and memorize five phrases from it
tomorrow morning before class.

228
00:13:05,145 --> 00:13:07,195
- Good night.	|Jeff Pierce
- Wait a minute, Wait a minute, Wait a minute.

229
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:09,456
You're bailing on our first sausage fest?

230
00:13:09,581 --> 00:13:11,772
This is your definition of friendship?	|Pierce Jeff

231
00:13:11,897 --> 00:13:14,989
No. This is my definition
of you trying way too hard,

232
00:13:15,114 --> 00:13:17,892
and me finding it harder 
and harder to stay polite.

233
00:13:18,017 --> 00:13:20,799
Now this was a fine enough way
to spend an evening, devoid of hope,

234
00:13:20,967 --> 00:13:22,759
but a woman I kind of like

235
00:13:22,927 --> 00:13:25,627
is out there in the moonlight
caring about something stupid,

236
00:13:25,854 --> 00:13:29,858
and this is my chance to show her that 
I care enough to act like I care about it too.	|Jeff Pierce

237
00:13:30,644 --> 00:13:32,897
- That's all you had to say, Jeff.	|Pierce Jeff
- That was it?

238
00:13:33,022 --> 00:13:35,814
That would've been great
if I had done that two hours ago!	|Jeff Pierce

239
00:14:18,712 --> 00:14:19,566
Nice sign.	|Britta Jeff

240
00:14:19,567 --> 00:14:20,567
Thanks.

241
00:14:21,649 --> 00:14:23,442
I like what you've done
with the place.	|Jeff Britta

242
00:14:25,328 --> 00:14:27,329
I think I was a little
too harsh on you.

243
00:14:27,454 --> 00:14:28,754
I'm not perfect.	|Britta Jeff

244
00:14:29,704 --> 00:14:32,162
I am.
I'd be happy to show you the ropes.	|Jeff Britta

245
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:33,620
Awesome!

246
00:14:34,578 --> 00:14:37,501
Look at awesome Jeffrey Winger.

247
00:14:37,767 --> 00:14:40,196
Too awesome for old Pierce

248
00:14:40,321 --> 00:14:41,929
with your hip shirts,

249
00:14:42,875 --> 00:14:44,382
and your gelled hair,

250
00:14:44,996 --> 00:14:46,248
and your cool

251
00:14:46,613 --> 00:14:48,163
tape over your mouth.	|Pierce Jeff

252
00:14:49,414 --> 00:14:51,389
Why is everybody wearing
tape over their mouth?	|Pierce All

253
00:14:51,894 --> 00:14:53,099
It's a protest, Pierce.	|Jeff Pierce

254
00:14:53,581 --> 00:14:54,377
Oh, good.

255
00:14:54,890 --> 00:14:56,891
Cause I know
what I'd like to protest...

256
00:14:57,016 --> 00:14:58,327
How much you hurt me.	|Pierce Jeff

257
00:14:58,452 --> 00:15:02,016
Conflicts like these will ultimately
bring us together as an unlikely family.	|Abed Troy

258
00:15:02,141 --> 00:15:05,899
- You have horrible breath right now.	|Troy Abed
- First, you constantly blow me off,

259
00:15:06,024 --> 00:15:07,447
then you want me to do your homework,

260
00:15:07,937 --> 00:15:11,368
then you tell me I'm trying too hard
to be your friend so you have to go.

261
00:15:11,686 --> 00:15:14,097
You have to come out here to pretend

262
00:15:14,222 --> 00:15:17,415
to care about the stupid
stuff she cares about.	|Pierce Jeff

263
00:15:17,728 --> 00:15:20,502
- His words, not mine.	|Pierce Britta
- He is paraphrasing.	|Jeff Britta

264
00:15:21,066 --> 00:15:22,391
Pierce, I got an idea.

265
00:15:22,516 --> 00:15:23,694
Why don't you go
get a cup of coffee,

266
00:15:23,818 --> 00:15:26,633
and hold some waitress hostage
with a monologue about your sperm.	|Jeff Pierce

267
00:15:27,002 --> 00:15:29,104
I'll show you some sperm, buddy.

268
00:15:29,505 --> 00:15:32,514
Was this your idea?
What the hell? Fire.	|Pierce Jeff

269
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:35,393
I'm not ready to die.	|Pierce All

270
00:15:39,233 --> 00:15:41,250
He's jumped in the fountain.

271
00:15:41,954 --> 00:15:42,954
He's fine.	|Jeff Britta

272
00:15:48,782 --> 00:15:51,453
- Have you seen it?	|Annie Britta
- We did it, girl... Page three.

273
00:15:51,578 --> 00:15:53,765
Its uh, mostly about Pierce,
but listen to that last paragraph.	|Shirley Britta

274
00:15:53,890 --> 00:15:57,141
"The incident occurred during a protest
regarding events in Guatemala."

275
00:15:57,266 --> 00:15:59,142
- Awareness!	|Annie Britta
- And this isn't the school paper, by the way.

276
00:15:59,267 --> 00:16:01,418
This is a real damn paper,
there's a marmaduke in there.	|Shirley Britta

277
00:16:01,586 --> 00:16:03,461
Well, it's more than 
I ever accomplished.	|Britta Shirley Annie

278
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:05,505
Did you guys know about 
the ethnic cleansing in Burma?	|Annie Shirley

279
00:16:05,674 --> 00:16:07,624
Need to bust out that brownie mix.	|Shirley Annie

280
00:16:12,518 --> 00:16:13,518
Morning.	|Jeff Britta
Morning.	|Britta Jeff

281
00:16:16,359 --> 00:16:18,762
Oh. no, I get it.
Garfield's wishing me a happy Arbor Day,

282
00:16:18,887 --> 00:16:20,729
- And you'd like a fresh start.	|Britta Jeff
- Nice try.

283
00:16:20,897 --> 00:16:24,378
It's actually secretary's day, and it says
that I'm sorry about crashing your protest

284
00:16:24,503 --> 00:16:26,735
with that drunken,
self-immolating baby boomer.	|Jeff Britta

285
00:16:26,903 --> 00:16:29,267
We don't blame you, sweetie.
Pierce has always been on my watch list.	|Shirley Jeff

286
00:16:29,392 --> 00:16:31,894
That dude is crazy...
He told me girls have two pee holes.	|Troy Jeff

287
00:16:32,019 --> 00:16:34,201
I sang Christmas carols
at a nursing home once.

288
00:16:34,326 --> 00:16:37,454
I've seen the face of dementia,
and last night I saw it again.	|Annie Jeff

289
00:16:37,579 --> 00:16:40,660
You know what he did
that's really crazy?

290
00:16:41,639 --> 00:16:45,032
He offered me $100
to switch cards with him

291
00:16:45,157 --> 00:16:47,339
just so he could be
partners with Jeff.

292
00:16:47,953 --> 00:16:51,578
I think he thought getting closer to Jeff
would bring him respect in the group.

293
00:16:52,053 --> 00:16:55,138
I think he spent his whole life
looking out for himself

294
00:16:55,306 --> 00:16:58,849
and he would trade it all
for a shot at some kind of family.	|Britta Group

295
00:17:08,218 --> 00:17:09,694
Hola, class.
Time for our presentations.

296
00:17:09,951 --> 00:17:12,444
First up was supposed to be
Jeff and Pierce,

297
00:17:12,569 --> 00:17:14,716
but Pierce explained the situation.

298
00:17:14,841 --> 00:17:18,702
Apparently there was a falling out,
things were said, people were betrayed.	|Chang All

299
00:17:20,418 --> 00:17:22,540
Jeff, having heard
Pierce's side of the story,

300
00:17:23,232 --> 00:17:25,835
I think the only humane thing to do
would be to give you a "C"

301
00:17:26,003 --> 00:17:29,058
and let Pierce do his presentation alone,
if that sounds fair to you.	|Chang Jeff

302
00:17:34,953 --> 00:17:36,861
That doesn't sound fair
to me at all.	|Jeff Chang

303
00:17:37,598 --> 00:17:39,808
Pierce, I understand that
if you don't want to be my friend,

304
00:17:40,087 --> 00:17:41,643
but this thing we've created...

305
00:17:42,148 --> 00:17:44,259
It is bigger than the both of us,

306
00:17:44,384 --> 00:17:47,049
and it deserves to be done right.	|Jeff Pierce

307
00:17:49,755 --> 00:17:50,755
All right.	|Pierce Jeff

308
00:17:54,389 --> 00:17:57,164
Okay, guys? Why are there costumes involved?
These are short conversations,

309
00:17:57,289 --> 00:17:59,619
- they're not supposed to take...	|Chang Jeff
- Your breath away?

310
00:18:01,122 --> 00:18:02,080
Well, tough.	|Jeff Chang

311
00:18:03,078 --> 00:18:04,266
You ready, amigo?	|Jeff Pierce
Si.	|Pierce Jeff

312
00:19:27,705 --> 00:19:28,513
F.	|Chang Jeff

313
00:19:29,113 --> 00:19:29,918
F-minus.	|Chang Pierce

314
00:19:30,744 --> 00:19:31,744
What?

315
00:19:33,261 --> 00:19:34,589
Did you say S?	|Pierce Chang

316
00:19:38,939 --> 00:19:39,680
So.

317
00:19:41,352 --> 00:19:43,598
That was one of the worst things
I have ever seen,

318
00:19:43,767 --> 00:19:47,448
which I guess makes being a part 
of it, a pretty selfless act,

319
00:19:47,573 --> 00:19:49,027
so I'm impressed.	|Britta Jeff

320
00:19:49,272 --> 00:19:52,353
Well, how do you know I didn't do it
just to get another shot at you?	|Jeff Britta

321
00:19:52,478 --> 00:19:54,367
Cause a smart guy like you
would know that

322
00:19:54,492 --> 00:19:57,957
no woman in that class would be able 
to look at you as a sexually viable candidate

323
00:19:58,082 --> 00:19:59,072
ever again.	|Britta Jeff

324
00:20:01,508 --> 00:20:02,450
No, I know.

325
00:20:02,618 --> 00:20:03,861
I thought of that.	|Jeff Britta

326
00:20:05,199 --> 00:20:06,499
She looked back.	|Jeff

327
00:20:09,995 --> 00:20:12,795
- You did an all right job 
up there, my friend.

328
00:20:13,457 --> 00:20:17,272
Thanks Pierce	|Jeff Pierce
A couple of notes

328
00:20:13,457 --> 00:20:17,272
You got this thing you do with your face
when you're trying to be funny

329
00:20:17,397 --> 00:20:20,997
that forces people to think
about how cool you think you are.	|Pierce Jeff

330
00:21:03,449 --> 00:21:04,397
Donde, está, la biblioteca. Me llamo T-Bone, la araña discoteca.	|Troy

330
00:21:03,449 --> 00:21:04,397
Discoteca, muñeca, la biblioteca. Está en bigotes grandes, el perro, manteca	|Abed

330
00:21:03,449 --> 00:21:04,397
Manteca, bigotes, gigante, pequeño, la cabeza es nieve, cerveza es bueno.	|Troy

330
00:21:03,449 --> 00:21:04,397
Buenos dias, me gusta papas frías, los bigotes de la cabra es Cameron Diaz!	|Abed

330
00:21:03,449 --> 00:21:04,397
Yeah boy. Boy.	|Abed

330
00:21:03,449 --> 00:21:04,397
Yeah	|Troy

330
00:21:03,449 --> 00:21:04,397
What? It's 2009.	|Abed

331
00:21:04,803 --> 00:21:05,635
Word.	|Troy
