1
00:00:00,267 --> 00:00:01,634
- Before we wrap up,
i would like to thank you guys

2
00:00:01,701 --> 00:00:04,300
For filling out these
anonymous evaluation cards.

3
00:00:04,367 --> 00:00:06,234
I found your feedback

4
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:08,901
To be largely constructive
and flattering,

5
00:00:08,968 --> 00:00:10,467
So gracias on that.	|Chang All
- De nada.	|Abed Chang

6
00:00:10,534 --> 00:00:11,367
- You don't have to sign
your name anymore.	|Chang Abed

7
00:00:11,434 --> 00:00:12,400
- Got it.	|Abed Chang

8
00:00:12,467 --> 00:00:14,868
- But there was
one evaluation

9
00:00:14,934 --> 00:00:17,968
That was so harsh
and hurtful

10
00:00:18,033 --> 00:00:20,567
And racist

11
00:00:20,634 --> 00:00:21,567
That i took the time
personally

12
00:00:21,634 --> 00:00:26,100
To analyze that handwriting
against past exams.

13
00:00:26,167 --> 00:00:28,334
And this particular coward

14
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:32,367
Dots her is with tiny,

15
00:00:32,434 --> 00:00:35,467
Itty-Bitty,
little circles.

16
00:00:35,534 --> 00:00:38,267
Boop. Boop.
Tcch!

17
00:00:38,334 --> 00:00:42,100
Isn't that precious
and cute?

18
00:00:42,167 --> 00:00:44,601
Who's "erratic
and unstable" now,

19
00:00:44,667 --> 00:00:47,367
Princess gringa?	|Chang Annie

21
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:52,400
- Nice day out today,
isn't it?	|Shirley Jeff

22
00:00:52,467 --> 00:00:55,767
- Yeah. Shoot!	|Jeff Shirley

23
00:00:55,834 --> 00:00:58,334
- You forget something?	|Britta Jeff
- Yeah.

24
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:00,801
I forgot to stagger the timing
of my exit with shirley's.

25
00:01:00,868 --> 00:01:02,767
We both have a class
across campus, and i can't go

26
00:01:02,834 --> 00:01:05,100
That kind of distance
with "ooh, that's nice."	|Jeff Britta

27
00:01:05,167 --> 00:01:06,534
- That's mean.	|Britta Jeff
- No.

28
00:01:06,601 --> 00:01:08,467
that's not nice.	|Jeff Britta

29
00:01:08,534 --> 00:01:10,334
- I find shirley very easy
to talk to,

30
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,701
And besides,
aren't you supposed to have,

31
00:01:11,767 --> 00:01:13,834
Like, an olympic gold medal
in jibber-Jabber?	|Britta Jeff

32
00:01:13,901 --> 00:01:15,767
- Yeah,
but i'm a sprinter.

33
00:01:15,834 --> 00:01:18,434
I'm at my best during
high-Speed bursts of wit.

34
00:01:18,501 --> 00:01:20,968
On a shirley walk, i'd be winded
by that stoner tree.	|Jeff Britta

35
00:01:21,033 --> 00:01:23,868
- Hey, britta, hi.
What's up?	|Vaughn Britta

36
00:01:23,934 --> 00:01:26,434
- Hey, vaughn, how's it going?	|Britta Vaughn
- No worries.	|Vaughn Britta

37
00:01:26,501 --> 00:01:28,200
- Interesting.
'Cause i might be worried

38
00:01:28,267 --> 00:01:29,901
If i was playing hacky sack
a decade too late.	|Jeff Britta

39
00:01:29,968 --> 00:01:31,801
- My class is that way.	|Britta Jeff

40
00:01:31,868 --> 00:01:33,601
- All right, but i just
wanted to point out

41
00:01:33,667 --> 00:01:35,834
That we easily walked
more than 100 yards

42
00:01:35,901 --> 00:01:37,234
With no awkward pauses,

43
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:39,501
And that is the sign
of a true friend.	|Jeff Britta

44
00:01:39,567 --> 00:01:43,467
- I'm really glad that you're
not hitting on me anymore.	|Britta Jeff

45
00:01:43,534 --> 00:01:46,701
- There's the awkward pause.	|Jeff Britta

47
00:01:50,801 --> 00:01:52,434
- Excuse me.
Oh, sorry, ladies.	|Annie Extra

48
00:01:52,501 --> 00:01:54,133
Professor duncan!
Professor duncan!	|Annie Duncan

49
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:56,133
- What?	|Duncan Annie
- Excuse me. Annie edison.

50
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:58,133
I'm in your 101 lecture.	|Annie Duncan
- Hello.	|Duncan Annie

51
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,567
- I've heard
about your special psych lab.	|Annie Duncan

52
00:01:59,634 --> 00:02:01,801
- Ah. The duncan principle.	|Duncan Annie
- Yes.

53
00:02:01,868 --> 00:02:03,701
And i know it's limited
to second-Year students,

54
00:02:03,767 --> 00:02:05,701
But i had
a 4.0 at riverside high,

55
00:02:05,767 --> 00:02:07,501
And i'm not looking down
on this school at all,

56
00:02:07,567 --> 00:02:09,567
But i'm only here because of
a brief addiction to pills

57
00:02:09,634 --> 00:02:11,601
That i was told
would help me...focus,

58
00:02:11,667 --> 00:02:13,934
But they actually made me lose
my scholarship and virginity.

59
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:14,834
So--	|Annie Duncan
- Right.	|Duncan Annie

60
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,567
- If you would let me
take your lab early,

61
00:02:16,634 --> 00:02:17,367
It would be a real feather
in my transcript.	|Annie Duncan

62
00:02:17,434 --> 00:02:19,968
- Okay, i've actually been
in this situation many times,

63
00:02:20,033 --> 00:02:21,667
So i'm just
going to be up front.

64
00:02:21,734 --> 00:02:22,300
I'm not allowed to date
students.	|Duncan Annie

65
00:02:22,367 --> 00:02:23,400
- Oh!	|Annie Duncan

66
00:02:23,467 --> 00:02:25,234
- Even though
you're an eight.	|Duncan Annie

67
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:26,534
- Oh!	|Annie Duncan
- Which is a british ten,

68
00:02:26,601 --> 00:02:28,033
So i'm angry.	|Duncan Annie
- Oh!	|Annie Duncan

69
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:30,834
- But if, in spite of that,
you are still interested,

70
00:02:30,901 --> 00:02:32,501
Then you may join the lab.

71
00:02:32,567 --> 00:02:35,501
Ah! Okay. You need to bring
two human subjects.

72
00:02:35,567 --> 00:02:38,901
And it would not hurt
your chances one bit

73
00:02:38,968 --> 00:02:40,834
If you could
lend me a fiver.

74
00:02:40,901 --> 00:02:42,534
I seem to have
left my purse in my duffle

75
00:02:42,601 --> 00:02:43,734
And my duffle in the boot
of my lorry, so--	|Duncan Annie

76
00:02:43,801 --> 00:02:44,267
- Oh.	|Annie Duncan

77
00:02:44,334 --> 00:02:46,100
- I asked politely, and then
panda took his pants off.	|Vaughn Britta

79
00:02:48,067 --> 00:02:50,467
I never even knew
that's what asexual meant.	|Britta Vaughn

80
00:02:50,534 --> 00:02:52,434
- I wonder what this
express package could be?

81
00:02:52,501 --> 00:02:54,801
Somebody had to get
something to me very fast.	|Pierce Group

82
00:02:54,868 --> 00:02:56,834
- You brought your mail
to campus?	|Shirley Pierce

83
00:02:56,901 --> 00:02:59,000
- Oh, yes.
My ear-Noculars.	|Pierce Group

84
00:02:59,067 --> 00:03:01,133
- What is that? It looks like
your bluetooth thingie.	|Troy Pierce

85
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:04,267
- No, no, no, no, no.
This is my cell phone headset.

86
00:03:04,334 --> 00:03:09,801
And this is ear-Noculars.

87
00:03:09,868 --> 00:03:11,734
It's for spies and whatnot.
It gives you sonic hearing.	|Pierce Troy

88
00:03:11,801 --> 00:03:13,601
- All hearing is sonic.	|Abed Pierce
- What's that?	|Pierce Group

89
00:03:13,667 --> 00:03:14,067
- So who wants to be
in a psych experiment?	|Annie Group

90
00:03:14,133 --> 00:03:15,567
- Hey, guys, guys, guys?

91
00:03:15,634 --> 00:03:19,667
Annie is talking about
some kind of experiment.	|Pierce Group

92
00:03:19,734 --> 00:03:21,801
- She's behind you.
Not interested.	|Jeff Pierce

93
00:03:21,868 --> 00:03:23,934
- Please?
You get paid.	|Annie Group

94
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,567
- Do they do stuff to your butt?	|Troy Annie
- No.	|Annie Troy

95
00:03:26,634 --> 00:03:29,000
- Do you get paid more if they
do stuff to your butt?	|Troy Annie

96
00:03:29,067 --> 00:03:30,601
- No.	|Annie Troy
- That's fine.

97
00:03:30,667 --> 00:03:31,567
I'll do it. I'm in.	|Troy Annie
- Yay!	|Annie Troy

98
00:03:31,634 --> 00:03:32,968
- How about you, abed?
It's tomorrow.	|Annie Abed

99
00:03:33,033 --> 00:03:34,501
- Ooh, tomorrow?

100
00:03:34,567 --> 00:03:36,534
They're showing all four
indiana joneses at the vista.

101
00:03:36,601 --> 00:03:37,567
I'm really looking forward
to the first three.

102
00:03:37,634 --> 00:03:38,534
I bought a whip.	|Abed Annie

103
00:03:38,601 --> 00:03:40,801
- This is really important
to me, abed.

104
00:03:40,868 --> 00:03:43,000
Could you please go
as my friend?

105
00:03:43,067 --> 00:03:44,601
My really good friend?	|Annie Abed

106
00:03:44,667 --> 00:03:46,167
- Wow, i didn't realize
we were really good friends.

107
00:03:46,234 --> 00:03:47,701
I figured we were more
like chandler and phoebe.

108
00:03:47,767 --> 00:03:50,734
They never really
had stories together.

109
00:03:50,801 --> 00:03:51,868
Sure, i'll do it,
chandler.	|Abed Annie

110
00:03:51,934 --> 00:03:54,901
- Oh, thank you, abed.	|Annie Abed
- Oh!	|Shirley Abed

111
00:03:54,968 --> 00:03:57,167
- I'm gonna go save britta
from that dude.	|Jeff Group

112
00:03:57,234 --> 00:03:58,968
- Yeah, she looks like
she's in trouble.	|Shirley Jeff

113
00:03:59,033 --> 00:04:00,901
Hope he doesn't try to
"handsome" her to death.	|Shrley Group

114
00:04:00,968 --> 00:04:02,567
- And panda has no pants.	|Vaughn Britta
- Hey.	|Jeff Britta

115
00:04:02,634 --> 00:04:03,567
- Hey, hi, what's up, man?
I'm vaughn.	|Vaughn Jeff

116
00:04:03,634 --> 00:04:05,334
- You in line?	|Jeff Vaughn
- Oh, no, no, no.

117
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,067
We're just, uh,
we're just chillin'.

118
00:04:06,133 --> 00:04:07,601
Hey, you're not gonna
order coffee?	|Vaughn Jeff

119
00:04:07,667 --> 00:04:09,300
- Oh, no, i was just
gonna see if britta--	|Jeff Vaughn

120
00:04:09,367 --> 00:04:11,234
- Hey, no judgment, bro.
I used to do coffee.

121
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:12,767
Then i made the switch
to green tea.

122
00:04:12,834 --> 00:04:14,234
It's, like--It's, like,

123
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:16,000
Filled with these antioxidants
and stuff.	|Vaughn Jeff

124
00:04:16,067 --> 00:04:16,267
- Hmm.	|Jeff Vaughn

125
00:04:17,334 --> 00:04:19,534
- It's pretty tight.	|Vaughn Jeff
- Tight. Yes.

126
00:04:19,601 --> 00:04:20,934
I've heard that
about green tea.	|Jeff Vaughn

127
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,434
- I like green tea.
I should make the change.	|Britta Vaughn

128
00:04:23,501 --> 00:04:24,567
- Up top, sugar bear.	|Vaughn Britta

130
00:04:25,934 --> 00:04:27,133
- Yeah, give me some of that.	|Jeff Vaughn
- There it is.	|Vaughn Jeff

131
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:29,000
- Small coffee, please.	|Jeff Extra

132
00:04:29,067 --> 00:04:31,601
- Britta's making the change
to green tea.	|Pierce Group

133
00:04:31,667 --> 00:04:33,801
- Oh, that's good.
It's good for your skin.	|Shirley Group

134
00:04:33,868 --> 00:04:36,167
- Welcome,
research assistants.

136
00:04:37,834 --> 00:04:39,601
If you turn your attention
to the monitor,

137
00:04:39,667 --> 00:04:40,901
You will see
that our subjects

138
00:04:40,968 --> 00:04:43,601
Are waiting for the experiment
to begin, but...

139
00:04:43,667 --> 00:04:46,033
It's actually
happening right now.	|Duncan All

140
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:48,100
- Wow.	|All Duncan

141
00:04:48,167 --> 00:04:49,934
You see, the waiting
is the experiment.

142
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,834
The duncan principle
is simple.

143
00:04:51,901 --> 00:04:53,934
Namely, that the more control
lost by the--

144
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,634
Yeah, i'm gonna
write this down too, actually.

145
00:04:56,701 --> 00:04:57,167
That's a good point.

146
00:04:57,234 --> 00:04:58,167
The more control
lost by the ego,

147
00:04:58,234 --> 00:05:01,501
The more gained by the id,

148
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:04,167
Resulting
in a surprisingly predictable

149
00:05:04,234 --> 00:05:07,734
Emotional eruption
or breaking point,

150
00:05:07,801 --> 00:05:11,634
Known to ma and pa as
a good old-Fashioned tantrum.

152
00:05:14,033 --> 00:05:15,400
Oh.	|Duncan All

153
00:05:15,467 --> 00:05:18,234
Annie, why don't you, uh,
go and tell our subjects

154
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:19,467
That we're going to be
starting the experiment

155
00:05:19,534 --> 00:05:23,167
In five minutes, okay?

156
00:05:23,234 --> 00:05:25,667
And annie...

157
00:05:25,734 --> 00:05:27,834
It's never actually
going to start.	|Duncan Annie

158
00:05:27,901 --> 00:05:29,200
Ho ho.	|Garrett All

159
00:05:31,567 --> 00:05:33,367
Let's do this.	|Duncan All

161
00:05:34,267 --> 00:05:35,400
- Hi, everyone.	|Annie All

162
00:05:35,467 --> 00:05:36,667
Hi, troy.	|Annie Troy

163
00:05:36,734 --> 00:05:38,200
Hi, abed.
- Hi.	|Troy Annie

164
00:05:38,267 --> 00:05:40,167
Hi, senor chang.	|Annie Chang

165
00:05:40,234 --> 00:05:42,534
- What, a community college
spanish teacher

166
00:05:42,601 --> 00:05:43,968
Can't use 80 bucks?	|Chang Annie

167
00:05:44,033 --> 00:05:47,701
- Well, we're just running
a little bit behind,

168
00:05:47,767 --> 00:05:50,334
So we'll probably start
in about five minutes.	|Annie Chang

169
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:54,367
- No, no, no!
No, no, no, no, no!

170
00:05:54,434 --> 00:05:56,267
It's unacceptable,
all right?

171
00:05:56,334 --> 00:05:57,767
You lied to me!

172
00:05:57,834 --> 00:05:59,968
When you say something
starts at 9:00,

173
00:06:00,033 --> 00:06:02,801
It starts at nueve!	|Chang Annie

174
00:06:04,084 --> 00:06:05,558
No!

175
00:06:07,166 --> 00:06:08,904
No!	|Chang All
- Houston, we have an idiot.	|Duncan All

176
00:06:21,649 --> 00:06:23,155
- Did you know we walk
the same way after class?

177
00:06:23,411 --> 00:06:25,408
I'm sure you didn't or else we
would've been walking together,

178
00:06:25,632 --> 00:06:26,610
Unless you're a jerk.

179
00:06:26,879 --> 00:06:27,956
Just kidding.	|Shirley Jeff

180
00:06:28,201 --> 00:06:29,849
- Let's do it.	|Jeff Shirley
- Mm-Hmm.

181
00:06:30,093 --> 00:06:32,406
Don't go too fast for
these dogs. Short legs.

182
00:06:37,964 --> 00:06:40,003
So how do you like--	|Shirley Jeff
- So you've got a kid, right?	|Jeff Shirley

183
00:06:40,117 --> 00:06:41,039
- What's that?	|Shirley Jeff
- Nothing.	|Jeff Shirley

184
00:06:44,970 --> 00:06:47,024
- So pierce isn't exactly
right in the head, is he?	|Shirley Jeff

185
00:06:48,585 --> 00:06:50,005
- I know a lot
of grown men

186
00:06:50,170 --> 00:06:51,779
With radar dishes
coming out of their ear.	|Jeff Shirley

187
00:06:52,131 --> 00:06:54,259
- he's like inspector gadget.	|Shirley Jeff

188
00:06:54,481 --> 00:06:56,043
- Yeah, go, go,
gadget incontinence.	|Jeff Shrley

189
00:06:56,212 --> 00:06:57,840
- And how about that guy
that's always around,

190
00:06:57,981 --> 00:06:58,882
flirting with britta?	|Shirley Jeff

191
00:06:59,035 --> 00:07:00,458
- I know!
He's the worst! Vaughn?	|Jeff Shirley

192
00:07:00,581 --> 00:07:02,073
- I know, and what is it
with his hair?	|Shirley Jeff

193
00:07:02,234 --> 00:07:03,242
- It's perpetually moist.	|Jeff Shrley

194
00:07:03,351 --> 00:07:05,734
- Okay, we're three hours in,
so let's review what we've seen.

195
00:07:05,841 --> 00:07:08,631
And pay close attention to
every subject's breaking point.

196
00:07:08,706 --> 00:07:13,009
We've got a shouter.

197
00:07:13,102 --> 00:07:14,858
- That one's a stomper.
Bye, hippie.

198
00:07:14,921 --> 00:07:17,312
There's a generic whack job,
bouncing up and down

199
00:07:17,411 --> 00:07:18,660
Like a six-Foot child.

200
00:07:18,778 --> 00:07:20,347
Shaking.
Write that down.

201
00:07:20,459 --> 00:07:21,539
Visible shakes.

202
00:07:22,579 --> 00:07:23,887
Look at the little one
chase the big one.

203
00:07:23,991 --> 00:07:25,849
Look at him go. I'm gonna
make him go quicker.

204
00:07:25,918 --> 00:07:27,897
It's like benny hill looks.
Whoo, ooh, ooh, get him.

205
00:07:27,983 --> 00:07:29,434
Come back again. Whoo,
ooh, ooh, get him.

206
00:07:29,504 --> 00:07:30,890
All right?
There's a bit of fun.

207
00:07:31,218 --> 00:07:32,333
It lightens the mood.

208
00:07:32,369 --> 00:07:33,808
And back to the present.

209
00:07:35,058 --> 00:07:36,955
And then there were two.

210
00:07:39,854 --> 00:07:40,783
Break.	|Duncan All

211
00:07:49,912 --> 00:07:53,102
No, no, no! Annie!

212
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:55,274
What is going on
in there?

213
00:07:55,421 --> 00:07:58,198
Why--?
What is taking so long?

214
00:07:59,206 --> 00:08:03,508
I've wasted all day
here for you.

215
00:08:03,959 --> 00:08:06,945
The soul train awards
were tonight.

216
00:08:07,132 --> 00:08:10,407
You promised butt stuff!	|Troy Annie

218
00:08:16,756 --> 00:08:18,391
- And he's out.
We got him.

219
00:08:18,569 --> 00:08:20,074
strike three.

220
00:08:20,211 --> 00:08:21,357
You're gone.	|Duncan All

221
00:08:21,737 --> 00:08:23,230
- There's so much dust
in here.	|Troy

222
00:08:23,465 --> 00:08:24,576
- Do you know what?

223
00:08:24,793 --> 00:08:27,375
The longer they wait,
the harder they break.

224
00:08:27,553 --> 00:08:29,004
Buckle up, students.	|Duncan All

226
00:08:30,215 --> 00:08:32,009
- Do you see how often
hacky sack takes his shirt off?

227
00:08:32,116 --> 00:08:33,859
He'd play shirts and skins
in a game of checkers.	|Shirley Jeff

228
00:08:33,968 --> 00:08:36,884
- I'm so glad to be able
to talk to someone about this.

229
00:08:37,043 --> 00:08:38,746
I wanted to say
something to britta about it,

230
00:08:38,897 --> 00:08:40,684
But we're supposed to be
friends now,

231
00:08:40,809 --> 00:08:42,093
And she'd think
i was jealous.	|Jeff Shirley

232
00:08:42,223 --> 00:08:43,884
- I don't see why you
and britta aren't together.

233
00:08:43,996 --> 00:08:45,962
Two cute white people,
going to school together,

234
00:08:46,031 --> 00:08:47,031
Just seems right.	|Shirley Jeff

235
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,879
- Shirley,
we're not pandas in a zoo.	|Jeff Shirley

237
00:08:50,697 --> 00:08:52,059
Oh. Oh, dear.	|Shirley Jeff

238
00:08:54,472 --> 00:08:56,519
- That is not
what i want to see.	|Jeff Shirley

239
00:09:02,162 --> 00:09:03,584
- There goes the shirt.	|Shirley Jeff

240
00:09:12,524 --> 00:09:12,631
- Hey.	|Britta Jeff

241
00:09:13,337 --> 00:09:15,451
- Hey, i'm fine.
How are--

242
00:09:15,522 --> 00:09:16,785
Want me to, uh,

243
00:09:16,835 --> 00:09:18,125
Want me to check you
for grass stains?	|Jeff Britta

244
00:09:18,195 --> 00:09:19,933
- I wasn't sure how or when
to bring up

245
00:09:20,012 --> 00:09:21,200
That i was hanging out
with vaughn.

246
00:09:21,282 --> 00:09:24,078
I figured that you'd
make fun of him...and me.	|Britta Jeff

247
00:09:24,185 --> 00:09:25,493
- Uh, first of all,

248
00:09:25,612 --> 00:09:27,308
Friends do not make
fun of each other,

249
00:09:27,421 --> 00:09:30,439
Even if they're being tackled
in the quad by a hippie,

250
00:09:30,512 --> 00:09:34,475
And secondly,
vaughn seems cool.	|Jeff Britta

251
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:36,804
- Well, you guys should
hang out sometime.

252
00:09:39,124 --> 00:09:40,345
I gotta go.

253
00:09:40,490 --> 00:09:42,408
I--Uh, that was tacky
out there.

254
00:09:42,505 --> 00:09:44,671
You won't ever
see that again.	|Britta Jeff

255
00:09:44,853 --> 00:09:47,097
- Oh, no worries, brah.	|Jeff Britta

256
00:09:53,877 --> 00:09:57,416
- Shirley, did you see
senor chang's socks today?

257
00:09:57,550 --> 00:09:59,063
Tiny bullfighters.	|Jeff Shirley

259
00:10:00,113 --> 00:10:01,165
- I can top that.

260
00:10:01,276 --> 00:10:02,705
Did you see that
hacky sack wears an anklet?

262
00:10:05,342 --> 00:10:07,026
Since when won't you
talk about vaughn?	|Shirley Jeff

263
00:10:07,178 --> 00:10:09,371
- Look, i'm trying to be
a good friend to britta.

264
00:10:09,483 --> 00:10:11,735
She thought i was gonna
make fun of him,

265
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:13,725
But i want to be
unpredictable.

266
00:10:17,871 --> 00:10:17,880
I'm gonna show her that i am not
the jerk she thinks i am

267
00:10:18,418 --> 00:10:19,936
And friend the hell out of

268
00:10:20,035 --> 00:10:22,799
That green-Tea-Drinking
drum circler.	|Jeff Shirley

269
00:10:22,897 --> 00:10:24,322
- Okay,
but tell me you've noticed

270
00:10:24,432 --> 00:10:25,547
How small his nipples are.	|Shirley Jeff

271
00:10:25,647 --> 00:10:27,141
- Not engaging.	|Jeff Shirley
- What?

272
00:10:27,218 --> 00:10:28,481
It's not gossip
when it's fact.

273
00:10:28,853 --> 00:10:30,480
My kids have got hamsters
with bigger nips.	|Shirley Jeff

274
00:10:30,662 --> 00:10:31,725
- No!	|Jeff Shirley
- Oh, well.	|Shirley Jeff

275
00:10:31,744 --> 00:10:32,775
- No!	|Jeff Shirley
- Jeff!	|Shirley Jeff

276
00:10:36,141 --> 00:10:38,353
- Is it on pause?	|Duncan Annie

277
00:10:39,177 --> 00:10:41,318
- No, that's just him.	|Annie Duncan

278
00:10:46,354 --> 00:10:49,037
Sorry you've been waiting
26 hours.

279
00:10:49,181 --> 00:10:52,105
It's just gonna be
another five minutes.	|Annie Abed

280
00:10:52,549 --> 00:10:54,016
- Okey-Dokey.	|Abed Annie

281
00:10:54,254 --> 00:10:55,631
- Oh, my...

282
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:57,715
Why won't he leave?	|Duncan

283
00:10:58,004 --> 00:10:59,169
- Professor.	|Garrett Duncan
- What?	|Duncan Garrett

284
00:10:59,554 --> 00:11:01,065
- I'm sorry,
but this guy's not moving.

285
00:11:01,193 --> 00:11:02,836
I have classes
to go to.	|Garrett Duncan

286
00:11:02,951 --> 00:11:04,561
- Go! Fine!

287
00:11:04,712 --> 00:11:07,238
Go kill john lennon again,
you loser.	|Duncan Garrett

288
00:11:08,545 --> 00:11:09,842
He's ruined my study!

289
00:11:10,011 --> 00:11:12,792
He has--He has warped
the duncan principle.

290
00:11:12,932 --> 00:11:16,183
Damn you,
you outlying piece of datum!

291
00:11:16,416 --> 00:11:17,394
ow! Aah!	|Duncan

292
00:11:21,191 --> 00:11:23,746
It's you!
It's your fault!	|Duncan Annie

293
00:11:23,842 --> 00:11:26,063
- But you told me
to bring subjects.	|Annie Duncan

294
00:11:26,148 --> 00:11:28,083
- Yeah, subjects!
Not rain man!

295
00:11:28,201 --> 00:11:30,106
I should never
have let you into this lab,

296
00:11:30,230 --> 00:11:32,813
Miss annie fanny
panties in a bunch!	|Duncan Annie

297
00:11:32,922 --> 00:11:35,669
- Oh! Oh,
that's so hilarious!

298
00:11:35,795 --> 00:11:36,747
Did you think of that

299
00:11:36,842 --> 00:11:38,370
The last time you
skipped a trip to the dentist?	|Annie Duncan

300
00:11:39,123 --> 00:11:41,050
- Oh, let me answer that
question with another question.	|Duncan Annie

302
00:11:47,872 --> 00:11:47,992
It's not--It's not fair!
It's not fair!

303
00:11:48,614 --> 00:11:50,009
Why, why, why?

304
00:11:50,172 --> 00:11:51,802
What are you doing?

305
00:11:51,907 --> 00:11:52,795
Put your--
Stop writing!

306
00:11:52,888 --> 00:11:54,073
Put your pen--
Give me that!

307
00:11:54,096 --> 00:11:55,318
Get out!
Get out, you dorks!

308
00:11:55,877 --> 00:11:56,637
Get out!	|Duncan All

309
00:11:59,452 --> 00:12:03,023
You have destroyed
the duncan principle!	|Duncan Annie

310
00:12:09,866 --> 00:12:10,994
- Go home!	|Annie Troy

311
00:12:15,150 --> 00:12:16,125
- Cool.

312
00:12:18,351 --> 00:12:18,407
See ya.	|Troy Annie

313
00:12:20,016 --> 00:12:22,671
- So britta said that you did
a lot of community service.	|Jeff Vaughn

314
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:24,784
- Ultimate frisbee
at the senior's center.

315
00:12:25,309 --> 00:12:26,282
It is amazing.	|Vaughn Jeff

316
00:12:26,478 --> 00:12:27,668
- And what makes frisbee
ultimate?	|Jeff Vaughn

317
00:12:28,825 --> 00:12:30,161
- Aw, man,

318
00:12:30,236 --> 00:12:31,649
For every time i wished
somebody asked me that.	|Vaughn Jeff

319
00:12:31,738 --> 00:12:33,371
- I'm gonna get dessert.
Want anything?	|Britta Vaughn Jeff

320
00:12:33,487 --> 00:12:34,521
- Carrots.	|Vaughn Britta

321
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:36,125
- Oh, i'm good.	|Jeff Britta

322
00:12:37,569 --> 00:12:39,447
- Hey, you two.	|Shirley Jeff Vaughn
- Hey.	|Vaughn Shirley

323
00:12:39,784 --> 00:12:41,755
- Well,

324
00:12:42,289 --> 00:12:43,519
- Thank you.
Thank you very much.	|Vaughn Shirley

325
00:12:43,767 --> 00:12:44,793
- Where's it from?	|Shirley Vaughn

326
00:12:44,885 --> 00:12:47,245
- Oh, uh,

327
00:12:47,276 --> 00:12:49,002
I guess it's--
Well, uh--

Hey, look at that.
"Hanes classic."	|Vaughn Shirley

329
00:12:51,843 --> 00:12:53,320
- Oh, that's nice.	|Shirley Vaughn

330
00:12:53,366 --> 00:12:55,084
- You know, people
underestimate the elderly,

331
00:12:55,170 --> 00:12:57,254
You know, but you
see these guys out there

332
00:12:57,324 --> 00:12:58,776
And they're
throwing the bee

333
00:12:58,882 --> 00:13:01,301
And they're just loving life.
It's just inspiring.	|Vaughn Jeff Shirley

334
00:13:01,374 --> 00:13:04,350
- You know, i'm gonna really--
I'm gonna think about it.	|Jeff Vaughn

335
00:13:04,416 --> 00:13:06,681
- All right. I'm gonna go
check on britts.

336
00:13:06,752 --> 00:13:08,067
See ya.	|Vaughn Jeff Shirley

337
00:13:08,451 --> 00:13:09,311
- See ya.	|Shirley Vaughn

338
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:11,179
- You are the devil.	|Jeff Shirley

339
00:13:11,335 --> 00:13:12,190
- I know.	|Shirley Jeff

340
00:13:12,553 --> 00:13:15,891
- Donde vaughn ustedes
los sabados?	|Jeff Shirley

341
00:13:17,347 --> 00:13:19,446
- Domingo, pl--

342
00:13:19,542 --> 00:13:20,781
Oh, okay, I--	|Britta Jeff

343
00:13:20,864 --> 00:13:21,974
- Where do we go
on saturdays?

344
00:13:22,031 --> 00:13:23,565
You said sunday.	|Jeff Britta
- I have a question for you.

345
00:13:24,353 --> 00:13:25,968
You like vaughn, right?	|Britta Jeff

346
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:27,997
- Oh, he--He's very cute.	|Jeff Britta

347
00:13:28,106 --> 00:13:29,057
- I'm just worried

348
00:13:29,156 --> 00:13:30,319
That he's thinking
a little bit more intensely

349
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:31,887
About this thing
than i am.

350
00:13:32,773 --> 00:13:33,921
He says stuff,
you know, after...	|Britta Jeff

351
00:13:35,848 --> 00:13:36,628
- School?	|Jeff Britta

352
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:38,658
- After...	|Britta Jeff
- Dinner mints?	|Jeff Britta

353
00:13:39,049 --> 00:13:39,860
- After...	|Britta Jeff

354
00:13:40,094 --> 00:13:41,480
- Not having sex?	|Jeff Britta

355
00:13:41,626 --> 00:13:42,361
- Ahh...	|Britta Jeff

356
00:13:43,938 --> 00:13:45,315
- How was that?	|Jeff Britta

357
00:13:45,445 --> 00:13:46,268
- What? Forget that.

358
00:13:47,161 --> 00:13:49,683
The problem right now
is that he's calling me "babe."

359
00:13:49,742 --> 00:13:50,830
He's trying to hold my hand.

360
00:13:50,912 --> 00:13:53,334
It's getting a little
relationship-Y.

361
00:13:53,432 --> 00:13:55,547
And he gave me something.	|Britta Jeff

362
00:13:56,541 --> 00:13:57,625
- Herpes?	|Jeff Britta

363
00:13:57,786 --> 00:13:59,374
- No. This.	|Britta Jeff

364
00:14:00,584 --> 00:14:01,512
- A poem?	|Jeff Britta

365
00:14:01,606 --> 00:14:03,347
- How do i respond
to something like that?

366
00:14:03,379 --> 00:14:04,409
"Thank you"?	|Britta Jeff

367
00:14:05,363 --> 00:14:07,255
- Well,
it's a very good question.

368
00:14:07,349 --> 00:14:09,250
And it's one
i will answer. Uh--

369
00:14:09,355 --> 00:14:10,917
Ooh, i'm getting a text.

370
00:14:10,995 --> 00:14:12,985
I'm just gonna read it,
if you don't mind.

371
00:14:13,084 --> 00:14:18,024
I am reading it,
and it is read.	|Jeff Britta

372
00:14:18,137 --> 00:14:22,860
"Did you ever notice where
the ocean meets the sky, did ya?

373
00:14:23,023 --> 00:14:28,264
It's the same wizard blue that
i see in your eye, brit-Ta."	|Jeff Shirley

374
00:14:28,365 --> 00:14:29,842
- Oh, no, no.
"Wizard blue"?	|Shirley Jeff

375
00:14:29,955 --> 00:14:31,272
- Yeah.	|Jeff Shirley

376
00:14:31,402 --> 00:14:33,435
- Thank you so much.
You just brightened my day.

377
00:14:33,502 --> 00:14:35,208
I'm so glad we can rip on
that dude again.	|Shirley Jeff

378
00:14:35,278 --> 00:14:36,386
- Look at this, look at this.

379
00:14:36,405 --> 00:14:39,893
That is the stain of a teardrop
over the word "rad."	|Jeff Shirley

380
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:41,579
- Oh, he said "rad"?
I thought he said "bad."

381
00:14:41,698 --> 00:14:42,823
Oh, that makes it worse.	|Shirley Jeff

382
00:14:42,917 --> 00:14:45,870
- I'm surprised he can read.	|Jeff Shirley
- Oh!	|Shirley Jeff

383
00:14:45,928 --> 00:14:47,113
- You know?	|Jeff Shirley
- I know.	|Shirley Jeff

384
00:14:48,523 --> 00:14:51,194
- Hey, sorry about bailing
on the psych experiment.	|Troy Annie

385
00:14:51,473 --> 00:14:53,497
- That was
the experiment, troy.

386
00:14:53,830 --> 00:14:55,735
We were testing to see how long
people would wait in the room.	|Annie Troy

387
00:14:57,113 --> 00:14:58,051
- Whoa.	|Troy

388
00:14:58,163 --> 00:14:59,429
- Oh, gotcha.	|Abed Annie

389
00:14:59,506 --> 00:15:01,270
- "Gotcha"?
That's all you have to say?	|Annie Abed

390
00:15:01,374 --> 00:15:02,002
- Yeah.	|Abed Annie

391
00:15:02,094 --> 00:15:05,378
- You sat in a room
for 26 straight hours.

392
00:15:05,457 --> 00:15:07,163
Didn't that bother you?	|Annie Abed

393
00:15:07,229 --> 00:15:09,068
- Yeah, i was livid.	|Abed Annie
- Then why didn't you leave?	|Annie Abed

394
00:15:09,149 --> 00:15:10,850
- Because you asked me to stay
and you said we were friends.	|Abed Annie

395
00:15:16,097 --> 00:15:17,916
- Wait. Is this still
part of the experiment?	|Troy Annie

396
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,049
- He's more like a puppy
with a fish mouth.	|Jeff Shirley

397
00:15:20,130 --> 00:15:21,568
- Right, right.
It's more like this.	|Shirley Jeff

399
00:15:24,325 --> 00:15:25,419
- That's right.
Laugh it up.

400
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:27,552
You guys want to know
what they're doing?	|Pierce Group

401
00:15:27,789 --> 00:15:28,618
- Yeah.	|Abed Pierce
- Sure.	|Troy Pierce

402
00:15:28,730 --> 00:15:29,868
- Making fun of all of us.	|Pierce Group

403
00:15:33,547 --> 00:15:36,247
I heard you with my own
ear...noculars.	|Pierce Jeff

404
00:15:36,307 --> 00:15:37,851
- Pierce, we are not
making fun of you.	|Jeff Pierce

405
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:39,154
- Uh-Huh.
Calling me "hacky sack"

406
00:15:39,246 --> 00:15:43,937
And ripping my--My six pack abs
and my moist hair.	|Pierce Annie

407
00:15:44,032 --> 00:15:45,259
And that face you made?

408
00:15:46,278 --> 00:15:47,653
Well, i think
it's pretty obviously annie.	|Pierce Shirley

409
00:15:48,569 --> 00:15:50,668
- Okay, this is definitely still
part of the experiment.	|Troy

410
00:15:50,763 --> 00:15:52,618
- Pierce, we were not
making fun of you.	|Jeff Pierce

411
00:15:52,699 --> 00:15:53,467
- Yeah.	|Shirley Pierce

412
00:15:53,532 --> 00:15:55,002
- We're making fun britta's
boyfriend, vaughn.	|Jeff Pierce

413
00:15:56,020 --> 00:15:57,864
- Oh, good.
Well, in that case.

414
00:15:57,989 --> 00:16:00,311
But if we're gonna do something,
let's do it as a team.

415
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:02,265
I'll get the ball rolling.
Maybe he has a tiny penis.	|Pierce Jeff Shirley

416
00:16:02,367 --> 00:16:03,525
- Who is this guy?	|Troy Group

417
00:16:03,605 --> 00:16:04,838
- You all have got
to see him.

418
00:16:05,052 --> 00:16:06,465
Everything's all,
"no worries, no worries."

419
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:08,378
And he always says hello
three times in a row.

420
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:09,680
Hello, good evening,
how are you?

421
00:16:09,758 --> 00:16:12,587
And--Here, look!
He wrote a poem!	|Shrley Group

422
00:16:12,648 --> 00:16:14,377
- Oh!
- Can i read it?

423
00:16:14,490 --> 00:16:16,016
- We shouldn't show that.
- Oh, no, it's fine.

424
00:16:16,101 --> 00:16:17,359
- So i'll be done in,
like, an hour.

425
00:16:17,436 --> 00:16:19,719
- Yeah. No worries.
- He just said it!

426
00:16:19,792 --> 00:16:22,145
- Guys,
you've met vaughn, right?

427
00:16:22,390 --> 00:16:23,348
- Hey. What's up? Hi.

428
00:16:24,549 --> 00:16:25,620
[Laughter]

429
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:29,510
This troop's got a case
of the giggles, huh?

430
00:16:35,516 --> 00:16:36,225
Is that--?

431
00:16:37,457 --> 00:16:38,981
Did you give them
my poem?

432
00:16:39,108 --> 00:16:40,851
- No.
- Okay, well,

433
00:16:40,913 --> 00:16:42,875
Why is the dinosaur rocking
a picture of my poem?

434
00:16:42,952 --> 00:16:44,079
- Here, read it.

435
00:16:47,366 --> 00:16:50,537
- Oh, you guys are--
Right?

436
00:16:50,644 --> 00:16:52,029
You guys are laughing at me,
aren't you?

437
00:16:52,073 --> 00:16:53,148
- Yeah.
- No.

438
00:16:53,225 --> 00:16:54,852
- That's uh, wow.

439
00:16:58,901 --> 00:17:00,855
This is the least tight thing
that's ever happened to me.

440
00:17:05,354 --> 00:17:06,592
- I can't believe you.

441
00:17:07,368 --> 00:17:08,929
- Honestly, jeff,
how dare you?

442
00:17:14,275 --> 00:17:15,029
- He's crying.

443
00:17:16,704 --> 00:17:18,357
Now he's barking.

444
00:17:20,764 --> 00:17:22,052
- Jeff, wait!
I'm sorry i sold you out.

445
00:17:22,126 --> 00:17:23,733
- Britta is never
gonna forgive me.

446
00:17:23,818 --> 00:17:25,408
I can't believe
i showed you that poem.

447
00:17:25,492 --> 00:17:27,504
Oh, my god, my life
is degrassi high.

448
00:17:27,614 --> 00:17:30,005
- Oh, jeff.
I have a gossip problem.

449
00:17:30,935 --> 00:17:32,787
I stir the pot, jeff.
I'm a pot stirrer.

450
00:17:32,891 --> 00:17:34,926
This isn't even the only study
group i've had this year.

451
00:17:35,016 --> 00:17:36,125
You see
those ladies over there?

452
00:17:37,489 --> 00:17:39,629
I used to be in their group
till they kicked me out.

453
00:17:39,737 --> 00:17:42,922
They call me "tattle-Ina."
It's a bumblebee nickname.

454
00:17:42,974 --> 00:17:44,958
It's--It's cute,
but it stings.

455
00:17:45,054 --> 00:17:46,715
- Hey, look at the size
of that woman's earrings.

456
00:17:46,791 --> 00:17:49,400
It's like little dogs
should be jumping through them.

457
00:17:49,477 --> 00:17:51,101
- Mmmmmmm!
- [Laughs]

458
00:17:51,152 --> 00:17:52,838
- This is never going to work.
- Look at them.

459
00:17:52,895 --> 00:17:54,350
- This has to end.
Mm-Mm, mm-Mm.

460
00:17:54,419 --> 00:17:57,783
- Shirley, don't do this.
Look, we can still hang out.

461
00:17:57,878 --> 00:18:00,731
It's just, you know,
we won't bag on people.

462
00:18:00,838 --> 00:18:02,382
- Come on, jeff.
What are we gonna talk about?

463
00:18:02,518 --> 00:18:03,917
My kids?
Your--Your doctor career?

464
00:18:04,001 --> 00:18:06,288
- I was a lawyer.
- See? I'm already bored.

465
00:18:07,046 --> 00:18:07,979
- [Sighs]

466
00:18:09,121 --> 00:18:12,580
Well, we'll always have
"tiny nipples."

467
00:18:12,686 --> 00:18:13,979
- [Laughs]
they were tiny.

468
00:18:14,070 --> 00:18:15,282
Okay.

469
00:18:15,407 --> 00:18:17,688
Jeff, wait. Wait.
I know i shouldn't do this,

470
00:18:17,773 --> 00:18:19,157
But one last
little piece of gossip.

471
00:18:21,374 --> 00:18:25,701
Britta told me she had
a sex dream about you.

472
00:18:25,772 --> 00:18:27,711
You still have a chance.

473
00:18:27,805 --> 00:18:29,591
[Squeals]
mm-Hmm. Mm-Mm.

474
00:18:29,669 --> 00:18:31,512
- Details.
- Mmmmmm! Mm-Mmm.

475
00:18:31,625 --> 00:18:32,896
- Details!
- Mm-Mmm!

476
00:18:32,977 --> 00:18:34,244
- Details!

477
00:18:37,534 --> 00:18:38,977
- Abed, here.

478
00:18:40,072 --> 00:18:42,212
I wanted to say sorry
for yelling at you.

479
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:47,409
- Indiana jones.
Cool.

480
00:18:47,472 --> 00:18:48,628
- I just got the first three
because...

481
00:18:48,698 --> 00:18:50,347
Together:
the fourth one blows.

482
00:18:51,987 --> 00:18:52,974
- We're cool.

483
00:18:53,092 --> 00:18:54,938
- I do not
want to talk to you.

484
00:18:55,019 --> 00:18:56,194
- No, i know,
and i'm sorry.

485
00:18:56,296 --> 00:18:59,031
I'm really sorry.
I'm really, really sorry,

486
00:18:59,130 --> 00:19:01,296
And i will go talk to vaughn
if you want me to.

487
00:19:01,368 --> 00:19:02,613
With me.
- Oh.

488
00:19:02,663 --> 00:19:03,398
Oh.

489
00:19:03,492 --> 00:19:05,514
- You broke my trust.
You suck.

490
00:19:05,588 --> 00:19:06,732
- I know, and i'm sorry,

491
00:19:06,804 --> 00:19:07,924
But i was
in a tough position.

492
00:19:08,053 --> 00:19:10,143
I couldn't handle
just being one of the girls.

493
00:19:14,443 --> 00:19:15,526
- What do you want to be?

494
00:19:15,739 --> 00:19:20,101
- Is there a spot on
the friendship spectrum

495
00:19:20,203 --> 00:19:21,584
Between total stranger

496
00:19:21,707 --> 00:19:23,964
And having to hear
about the guys you date?

497
00:19:24,066 --> 00:19:26,169
And ideally,
just a notch underneath

498
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:28,392
Driving you to the airport
and painting your kitchen?

499
00:19:28,482 --> 00:19:29,561
- How about the friend level

500
00:19:29,625 --> 00:19:31,231
Where you sometimes
have to cat-Sit?

501
00:19:31,346 --> 00:19:32,823
- Done.

502
00:19:32,927 --> 00:19:35,512
And if i'm occasionally naked
in your dreams,

503
00:19:35,599 --> 00:19:36,897
I won't complain.

504
00:19:37,017 --> 00:19:38,033
- Shirley.
- I know.

505
00:19:38,119 --> 00:19:39,698
She's got a problem.
She stirs the pot.

506
00:19:39,787 --> 00:19:41,144
She's a pot stirrer.

507
00:19:42,243 --> 00:19:43,290
- Sorry, dudes.

508
00:19:44,081 --> 00:19:45,209
- No worries, man.

509
00:19:45,428 --> 00:19:48,628
- Yeah, some worries, man.
Some worries.

510
00:19:48,809 --> 00:19:50,148
- * now there was a time *

511
00:19:51,734 --> 00:19:52,642
- Whoa.

512
00:19:52,747 --> 00:19:54,275
* when you loved me so *

513
00:19:57,264 --> 00:19:58,227
* i couldn't run *

514
00:20:00,304 --> 00:20:01,896
- Shirley would have said
something funny about that guy.

515
00:20:01,999 --> 00:20:03,206
* *

516
00:20:03,251 --> 00:20:05,617
- [Laughs]
and so i told him...

517
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:07,307
Oh, hey--Hey, jeff.

518
00:20:07,432 --> 00:20:09,094
- Shh shh shh shh.

519
00:20:09,223 --> 00:20:10,446
- Oh, no.

520
00:20:10,719 --> 00:20:12,649
Pierce! Pierce,
give me your ear-Thing.

521
00:20:12,726 --> 00:20:14,014
- Got rid of it.

522
00:20:17,650 --> 00:20:18,723
You see, jeff,
there are certain things

523
00:20:18,809 --> 00:20:20,183
Man was not meant
to hear.

524
00:20:21,317 --> 00:20:24,809
We were designed,
by whatever entity you choose,

525
00:20:24,972 --> 00:20:27,565
To hear
what's in this range,

526
00:20:27,689 --> 00:20:30,113
And really,
this range alone.

527
00:20:30,537 --> 00:20:32,460
Because you know who's
talking to us in this range?

528
00:20:34,006 --> 00:20:35,543
The people we love.

529
00:20:35,608 --> 00:20:36,936
- * how you like me now? *

530
00:20:37,004 --> 00:20:38,204
* how you like me now?... *

531
00:20:43,605 --> 00:20:45,689
- He must have heard us
call him inspector gadget.

532
00:20:50,872 --> 00:20:51,964
[Imitates a stoner]
- Oh, i think it's time

533
00:20:52,032 --> 00:20:53,180
For burning man.

534
00:20:53,253 --> 00:20:55,848
[Dorky voice]
- Ew, i'm saddam hussein. Ew.

535
00:20:55,918 --> 00:20:57,736
[Imitates a stoner]
- Nice to meet you, dude.

536
00:20:57,798 --> 00:21:00,899
[Imitates woman]
- Ooh, wow. I love reading and
being a desperate housewife.

537
00:21:01,008 --> 00:21:02,808
[With jamaican accent]
- Hey, man, coming through.

538
00:21:02,871 --> 00:21:04,271
I love
de desperate housewives.

539
00:21:04,339 --> 00:21:08,347
[Snotty guy voice]
- I'm dr. Doogie seacrest.

540
00:21:08,383 --> 00:21:11,238
I think i'm better than
everyone else because i'm 40.

541
00:21:11,305 --> 00:21:12,268
- I'm not 40.

542
00:21:13,250 --> 00:21:15,288
I can hear you through
the window, morons.

543
00:21:19,135 --> 00:21:20,542
- Just pretend
like you're asleep.
