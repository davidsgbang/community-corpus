00:00:02,521 --> 00:00:03,955
Before we start,

2
00:00:04,023 --> 00:00:06,123
I'd like to have a preliminary powwow,

3
00:00:06,191 --> 00:00:08,763
or prelimi-wow, about what I'm calling

4
00:00:08,830 --> 00:00:10,991
our library's backdoor conundrum.

5
00:00:11,059 --> 00:00:12,746
Sounds like a porno with Kate Winslet.

6
00:00:12,813 --> 00:00:13,948
Abed, ew.

7
00:00:14,015 --> 00:00:16,790
The door on that side
is locked after 5:00,

8
00:00:16,857 --> 00:00:19,532
which means that most of us
have to walk all the way around.

9
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:21,237
Now, if we were to move
our meetings to 4:30...

10
00:00:21,304 --> 00:00:22,976
- No.
- No.

11
00:00:23,044 --> 00:00:27,052
I have a regular class at that time.

12
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:29,525
It's like math or
other regular classes.

13
00:00:29,593 --> 00:00:32,130
I have something unimportant
that can't ever move.

14
00:00:32,198 --> 00:00:34,135
Well, maybe one of us
could stand by the back door

15
00:00:34,202 --> 00:00:35,470
and let the rest in?

16
00:00:35,537 --> 00:00:37,573
- I nominate Pierce.
- Where is he?

17
00:00:37,641 --> 00:00:39,410
I have not seen him around all day.

18
00:00:39,478 --> 00:00:42,214
I haven't either.

19
00:00:42,282 --> 00:00:43,583
- Well, has anyone called him?
- I did.

20
00:00:43,651 --> 00:00:45,587
Several times, actually,
but he never returned my calls.

21
00:00:45,654 --> 00:00:47,923
Oh, no!

22
00:00:47,991 --> 00:00:50,394
Oh, the last thing
I said to him was "suck it".

23
00:00:50,461 --> 00:00:52,096
- Me too.
- Good morning.

24
00:00:52,164 --> 00:00:53,833
- Oh!
- Yes!

25
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:55,604
Thank God.

26
00:00:55,672 --> 00:00:57,039
You thought I was dead, didn't you?

27
00:00:57,107 --> 00:00:58,368
<i>No...</i>

28
00:00:58,369 --> 00:00:59,208
I did.

29
00:00:59,276 --> 00:01:01,544
You people have any idea
how emasculating that is?

30
00:01:01,612 --> 00:01:03,080
I'm not Mickey Rooney.

31
00:01:03,148 --> 00:01:05,049
You don't have to cross your
fingers to see if I'll show up.

32
00:01:05,117 --> 00:01:06,517
You know, when I was 30,

33
00:01:06,585 --> 00:01:09,387
people used to wish that
I was dead to my face!

34
00:01:09,455 --> 00:01:12,391
That's called respect.

35
00:01:12,459 --> 00:01:14,293
Who is the lucky brunette?

36
00:01:14,361 --> 00:01:16,629
Last name Beeswax,
first name none-a-ya.

37
00:01:16,697 --> 00:01:18,432
Oh, my third wife was biracial.

38
00:01:18,499 --> 00:01:21,302
- Stop it!
- I am just trying to help

39
00:01:21,370 --> 00:01:23,605
keep you out of trouble.
What if the next girl saw these?

40
00:01:23,672 --> 00:01:25,440
Well, then she would know it was hers.

41
00:01:25,508 --> 00:01:27,676
Jeff!

42
00:01:27,744 --> 00:01:30,045
You're sleeping with a woman
you already slept with?

43
00:01:30,113 --> 00:01:31,547
Can't I be the friend in the group

44
00:01:31,615 --> 00:01:33,549
whose trademark is his
well-defined boundaries,

45
00:01:33,617 --> 00:01:36,219
like privacy smurf, discreet bear or...

46
00:01:36,287 --> 00:01:37,487
confidentiality spice?

47
00:01:37,555 --> 00:01:38,622
But if you like her,

48
00:01:38,689 --> 00:01:40,157
why would you want to
keep her a secret?

49
00:01:40,225 --> 00:01:41,325
Don't you want us to meet her?

50
00:01:41,393 --> 00:01:43,594
We have an agreement
to keep it low-key.

51
00:01:43,662 --> 00:01:45,396
That's ridiculous.
Obviously, it's a guy.

52
00:01:45,464 --> 00:01:47,765
You're wrong, Pierce.
It's two guys.

53
00:01:47,833 --> 00:01:49,935
Sometimes I do wish you were dead.

Professor Slater, quick question.

69

You know the answer, Mr. Winger.

70
00:02:36,755 --> 00:02:37,922
I don't date students,

I'm actually kind of
seeing someone right now,

73
00:02:41,927 --> 00:02:43,661
- thank you very much.
- Really? How's that going?

74
00:02:43,729 --> 00:02:45,597
Fine for now. She's smart and pretty.

75
00:02:45,665 --> 00:02:47,265
But sometimes I feel like
she's just waiting for me

there's that transcript you wanted.

00:03:13,059 --> 00:03:14,626
Jeff, I didn't expect to see you here.

89
00:03:14,694 --> 00:03:17,095
Hopefully, I'm not... interrupting.

90

[Laughter]

91
00:03:19,165 --> 00:03:21,966
You know, we laugh... but the fact is,

92
00:03:22,034 --> 00:03:24,202
student/teacher relationships
do happen,

93
00:03:24,269 --> 00:03:25,937
and they are a magnet for lawsuits.

94
00:03:26,005 --> 00:03:27,238
So we do stay vigilant.

00:03:27,306 --> 00:03:30,041
In fact, physically attractive
students and faculty

- Yes, Professor Seven...

- Uh, Slater.
- I'll return this tomorrow.

103
00:03:43,655 --> 00:03:44,588
Okay, then.

quite a few favors from God...

109

taken modern dance?

Since last semester.

126
00:04:50,447 --> 00:04:52,314
Coach told me it would
help with my coordination,

127
00:04:52,382 --> 00:04:55,416
and I fell in love with it,
in a very straight way.

I know it's tempting to sneak a peek,

129

but I'm gonna need for you
to keep your eyes up here!

dismissed you as a shallow jock.

spent that much time together.

I started last semester too.

00:05:10,664 --> 00:05:12,631
It was always something
that I wanted to do,

137
00:05:12,699 --> 00:05:15,467
but it was too embarrassing,
so I never told anyone.

138

and energy we're putting

we're passionate about.

the group, together?

Well, Jeff acts as sort
of the dad of the group,

172
00:06:53,988 --> 00:06:55,889
so emotionally this is
kind of like being told

173

that you're our new mom.

174
00:06:57,291 --> 00:06:59,125

nothing like that, right?

Absolutely. Do you cook macaroni?

is we all understand

178
00:07:05,264 --> 00:07:09,433
Professor Slater and
I need this to be our little secret.

179
00:07:09,501 --> 00:07:10,668
Everyone understand that?

180
00:07:10,735 --> 00:07:12,069
- Yeah.
- Yes. I do like macaroni.

181
00:07:12,137 --> 00:07:15,271
[overlapping agreement]
Sure.

182
00:07:15,339 --> 00:07:16,572
[Overlapping chatter]

183
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:17,907
See? All good.

184
00:07:17,974 --> 00:07:20,843
Well, thank you, everyone.
I appreciate it.

185
00:07:20,911 --> 00:07:22,411
I should get going.

186
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:24,880
- Ooh!
- Ooh...

187
00:07:28,384 --> 00:07:30,818
- Bye.
- Bye.

188
00:07:30,886 --> 00:07:32,920
Well, Jeff,

189
00:07:32,988 --> 00:07:35,756
you've taken a big step in
knocking down the barriers

190
00:07:35,823 --> 00:07:38,258
between students and teachers...

191
00:07:38,326 --> 00:07:40,693
- Just like Rosa Parks.
- I don't think it's like that.

192
00:07:40,761 --> 00:07:41,761
No, it's just like that.

193
00:07:41,828 --> 00:07:43,262
I feel if you need to explain it,

194
00:07:43,330 --> 00:07:45,796
it's not just like that.

195
00:07:45,864 --> 00:07:48,098
Is your heart gonna be okay with this?

196
00:07:48,166 --> 00:07:50,633
I will try to find
the tools to survive.

197
00:07:50,701 --> 00:07:52,669
Okay.

198
00:07:52,736 --> 00:07:54,670
Hey, everybody, speaking of secrets,

199
00:07:54,738 --> 00:07:57,006
Troy and I have something that
we would like to announce.

200
00:07:57,074 --> 00:07:58,941
[shrilly] - Oh!
- No. No.

201
00:07:59,009 --> 00:08:00,776
There's a dance recital on Friday,

202
00:08:00,843 --> 00:08:02,610
and I would be honored
if you guys would attend,

203
00:08:02,678 --> 00:08:06,046
because since last semester, I...

204
00:08:06,114 --> 00:08:08,448
have been taking a tap class.

205
00:08:08,516 --> 00:08:10,717
[Laughter]

206
00:08:10,784 --> 00:08:12,651
That's... f... funny.

207
00:08:12,719 --> 00:08:15,019
Well, I don't know how funny it is.

208
00:08:15,087 --> 00:08:17,821
Come on... we're not making fun of you.

209
00:08:17,889 --> 00:08:19,589
But obviously, you kept it a secret

210
00:08:19,657 --> 00:08:21,791
- because you saw the irony too.
- Irony?

211
00:08:21,858 --> 00:08:23,992
Well, you're not a typically
vulnerable or feminine person,

212
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:25,426
and the act of dancing is considered

213
00:08:25,494 --> 00:08:28,729
- both vulnerable and feminine.
- I disagree.

214
00:08:28,797 --> 00:08:30,497
What about fred Astaire?
What about Baryshnikov?

215
00:08:30,565 --> 00:08:32,299
Yeah, I guess.

216
00:08:32,367 --> 00:08:33,700
There are exceptions to the rule,

217
00:08:33,768 --> 00:08:36,069
but even when Jerry Rice went on
dancing with the stars...

218
00:08:36,136 --> 00:08:37,603
Jerry Rice?

219
00:08:37,671 --> 00:08:41,407
Oh, God. I liked him.

220
00:08:41,474 --> 00:08:43,541
Troy?

221
00:08:43,609 --> 00:08:45,843
What... what's your secret?

222
00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:48,645
Um...

223
00:08:48,713 --> 00:08:50,414
M... my secret...

224
00:08:50,481 --> 00:08:52,682
is that...

225
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:54,349
I knew Britta's secret.

226
00:08:54,417 --> 00:08:55,351
[gasps]
Yeah.

227
00:08:55,419 --> 00:08:56,718
I saw her in her dance outfit,

228
00:08:56,786 --> 00:08:58,620
and she looked ridiculous.

229
00:08:58,687 --> 00:09:00,854
So I helped her protect her shame.

230
00:09:00,922 --> 00:09:02,890
You know, I'm just glad she's out now.

231
00:09:02,957 --> 00:09:04,391
- Bravo, Britta.
- Thanks.

232
00:09:04,459 --> 00:09:06,526
Mr. Winger, there you are.

233
00:09:06,594 --> 00:09:08,596
Just got word of your relationship

234
00:09:08,663 --> 00:09:11,131
with Professor Slater.

235
00:09:11,199 --> 00:09:13,700
I'd like to see both of you
in my office in half an hour.

236
00:09:13,768 --> 00:09:15,001
What the... none of you left the room.

237
00:09:15,069 --> 00:09:16,302
How is that even possible?

238
00:09:16,370 --> 00:09:20,005
Well, for one thing,
it's all over Twitter.

239
00:09:23,309 --> 00:09:25,175
Britta in a tutu... Can you imagine?

240
00:09:25,243 --> 00:09:27,910
Hey. What the hell?

241
00:09:27,978 --> 00:09:30,278
I thought we were supposed to
come out to the group together.

242
00:09:30,346 --> 00:09:33,246
Yeah. I changed my mind.

243
00:09:33,314 --> 00:09:35,346
Well, they're gonna find out
that you dance at the recital.

244
00:09:35,414 --> 00:09:37,486
I'm not gonna be in the recital.

245
00:09:37,554 --> 00:09:39,188
- I'm dropping the class.
- Oh, my God.

246
00:09:39,255 --> 00:09:41,823
How can you do this?
I'm so disappointed in you.

247
00:09:41,891 --> 00:09:43,491
Hey, you don't get to
talk to me like that.

248
00:09:43,559 --> 00:09:45,226
You are not Shirley!

249
00:09:45,294 --> 00:09:46,893
And Shirley's not my mom.

250
00:09:46,961 --> 00:09:49,796
Britta, it's not like we
were in the same boat.

251
00:09:49,863 --> 00:09:51,764
Girls are supposed to dance.

252
00:09:51,831 --> 00:09:53,899
That's why God gave them
parts that jiggle.

253
00:09:53,967 --> 00:09:56,267
But I'd be going from
starting quarterback

254
00:09:56,335 --> 00:09:58,203
to a guy that twirls around in tights.

255
00:09:58,270 --> 00:10:00,304
I've got way more to lose
getting up on that stage

256
00:10:00,372 --> 00:10:01,372
because I'm a man.

257
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,673
Well, guess what?

258
00:10:02,741 --> 00:10:04,575
A real man doesn't bail on his friends

259
00:10:04,642 --> 00:10:06,543
or on himself.

260
00:10:06,611 --> 00:10:08,912
You're a dancer, Troy.

261
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:11,815
It's who you are.

262
00:10:11,883 --> 00:10:14,017
Not anymore.

263
00:10:15,787 --> 00:10:17,287
Excuse me.

264
00:10:21,490 --> 00:10:22,890
Upset about Jeff?

265
00:10:22,958 --> 00:10:26,125
No. I am upset about...

266
00:10:26,193 --> 00:10:28,124
something I can't talk about.

267
00:10:28,192 --> 00:10:29,558
We can talk about anything...

268
00:10:29,626 --> 00:10:31,994
politics, medicine, Jeff.

269
00:10:32,061 --> 00:10:35,097
Okay. Uh, did you hear
that the shroud of turin...

270
00:10:35,164 --> 00:10:36,965
Here's the thing about Jeff.

271
00:10:37,033 --> 00:10:38,166
Wow.

272
00:10:38,234 --> 00:10:40,135
Chasing after you
made him a better person

273
00:10:40,203 --> 00:10:41,803
because you always
called him on his stuff.

274
00:10:41,871 --> 00:10:43,705
All this time,
you've been warming him up

275
00:10:43,772 --> 00:10:45,906
and stirring in sweetener
and making him just right.

276
00:10:45,974 --> 00:10:48,308
And, sure, you weren't ready
to take a sip yet,

277
00:10:48,376 --> 00:10:49,609
but that didn't mean you want somebody

278
00:10:49,677 --> 00:10:50,844
to snatch him off the counter

279
00:10:50,911 --> 00:10:52,478
and guzzle him down
right in front of you.

280
00:10:52,546 --> 00:10:54,146
Shirley, I did not warm Jeff up.

281
00:10:54,214 --> 00:10:55,814
Nobody ever will.

282
00:10:55,882 --> 00:10:58,817
Do you think Professor Slater
is getting flowers right now?

283
00:10:58,884 --> 00:11:00,952
Do you think that they are
gonna go to the movies

284
00:11:01,019 --> 00:11:03,687
and hold hands, visit her parents?

285
00:11:03,755 --> 00:11:05,555
No. The only thing keeping them going

286
00:11:05,623 --> 00:11:07,290
was the thrill of the secrecy,

287
00:11:07,358 --> 00:11:11,127
and now that it is out,
it is over, believe me.

288
00:11:11,194 --> 00:11:12,861
Can... can I just ask

289
00:11:12,929 --> 00:11:15,464
as a divorced black housewife...

290
00:11:15,531 --> 00:11:17,332
What part of being a
single white slacker

291
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:18,933
makes you people so jaded?

292
00:11:19,001 --> 00:11:20,634
Ooh! You people?

293
00:11:20,702 --> 00:11:22,970
What do you mean, you people?

294
00:11:23,037 --> 00:11:24,804
I cannot believe I got to say that.

295
00:11:24,872 --> 00:11:27,873
It's the little things, isn't it?

296
00:11:27,941 --> 00:11:29,841
Okay, well, now that your
secret is out there,

297
00:11:29,909 --> 00:11:31,076
I'm just gonna talk you

298
00:11:31,144 --> 00:11:33,178
through this teacher/student
relationship form,

299
00:11:33,245 --> 00:11:36,113
and then we can get you two
on your very attractive way.

300
00:11:36,181 --> 00:11:38,148
We haven't even admitted
to being a couple.

301
00:11:38,216 --> 00:11:40,050
In fact, this is all based on hearsay,

302
00:11:40,117 --> 00:11:42,452
worse than hearsay.
Pierce's Twitter account,

303
00:11:42,519 --> 00:11:43,819
in which he says he's 47

304
00:11:43,887 --> 00:11:46,122
and teaches a women'
s-only pilates class.

305
00:11:46,189 --> 00:11:48,190
Jeff, it's okay. It's out.

306
00:11:48,258 --> 00:11:50,125
And you know what?
It doesn't bother me.

307
00:11:50,193 --> 00:11:51,359
I'm happy.

308
00:11:51,427 --> 00:11:53,628
Sweet.

309
00:11:53,696 --> 00:11:55,630
Well... [chuckles]
First question.

310
00:11:55,697 --> 00:11:57,298
"How long have you been doing it?"

311
00:11:57,365 --> 00:11:59,466
Oh! [Laughs]
Not it.

312
00:11:59,534 --> 00:12:01,468
I mean this... dating.

313
00:12:01,535 --> 00:12:03,669
- A few weeks.
- Mm-hmm.

314
00:12:03,737 --> 00:12:06,839
And... how long have you been doing it?

315
00:12:06,906 --> 00:12:08,373
We don't have to answer that.

316
00:12:08,441 --> 00:12:09,975
Oh, it... hmm?

317
00:12:10,042 --> 00:12:13,077
Now... this is just hypothetical.

318
00:12:13,145 --> 00:12:14,879
Might you ever consider

319
00:12:14,947 --> 00:12:16,814
spending the night with a third person?

320
00:12:16,882 --> 00:12:20,250
- That's not on there!
- Well...

321
00:12:20,318 --> 00:12:21,751
Wow, it's on there.

322
00:12:21,819 --> 00:12:23,587
Just exploring your options, obviously.

323
00:12:23,654 --> 00:12:26,322
[Laughs]
No agenda.

324
00:12:26,390 --> 00:12:28,624
I'll put "TBD".

325
00:12:28,692 --> 00:12:30,926
Would you describe yourself
as boyfriend and girlfriend?

326
00:12:30,994 --> 00:12:33,095
- Yes.
- Eh...

327
00:12:33,162 --> 00:12:34,562
- What?
- Oh, boy.

328
00:12:34,630 --> 00:12:36,897
It's semantics, really, isn't it?

329
00:12:36,965 --> 00:12:38,766
[Laughs]
We've slept together

330
00:12:38,833 --> 00:12:40,667
every night for the last three weeks.

331
00:12:40,735 --> 00:12:42,035
How would you describe me?

332
00:12:42,103 --> 00:12:44,070
The best friend ever.

333
00:12:44,138 --> 00:12:45,671
Ooh.

334
00:12:45,739 --> 00:12:47,573
Well, uh...

335
00:12:47,641 --> 00:12:49,541
I guess I've had the
wrong idea about us.

336
00:12:49,609 --> 00:12:51,243
But you know what? This is good.

337
00:12:51,310 --> 00:12:54,612
I'd be better off dating,
um... an adult.

338
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:56,113
See you around.

339
00:12:56,181 --> 00:12:59,950
- Michelle.
- Mm. Rarr!

340
00:13:02,153 --> 00:13:03,586
I'll get the break-up form.

341
00:13:09,824 --> 00:13:12,892
I got freaked out by
that boyfriend label.

342
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:14,494
I'm...

343
00:13:14,562 --> 00:13:15,828
afraid of commitment.

344
00:13:15,896 --> 00:13:17,030
How original.

345
00:13:17,097 --> 00:13:18,864
Look, the biggest
truths aren't original.

346
00:13:18,932 --> 00:13:22,234
Truth is ketchup. It's Jim Belushi.

347
00:13:22,301 --> 00:13:24,235
Its job isn't to blow our minds.

348
00:13:24,303 --> 00:13:25,637
It's to be within reach,

349
00:13:25,704 --> 00:13:26,938
so the truth is...

350
00:13:27,005 --> 00:13:28,873
I get claustrophobic
when things get official.

351
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:31,075
You're acting like I'm a Venus flytrap.

352
00:13:31,142 --> 00:13:33,343
I didn't want or need more
than what we were doing.

353
00:13:33,411 --> 00:13:35,378
Let's get back to it.
Should I get the door?

354
00:13:35,446 --> 00:13:37,580
I can't now, because you
went to the friend place.

355
00:13:37,648 --> 00:13:39,548
That's you getting official, not me,

356
00:13:39,616 --> 00:13:41,583
because unless there's
something I need to know

357
00:13:41,651 --> 00:13:43,884
about the lunch lady or that
blonde in your Spanish class

358
00:13:43,952 --> 00:13:45,919
with the infinite supply
of leather jackets,

359
00:13:45,987 --> 00:13:47,920
somewhere between our 9th
and 11th slumber party,

360
00:13:47,988 --> 00:13:49,489
statistically speaking,

361
00:13:49,556 --> 00:13:51,324
most people would call
us more than pals.

362
00:13:51,392 --> 00:13:53,259
Yeah, but soon as you say it,

363
00:13:53,327 --> 00:13:54,727
it can get complicated and messy.

364
00:13:54,794 --> 00:13:56,695
- How?
- Because when you say it,

365
00:13:56,762 --> 00:13:59,030
later on, you might have to un-say it.

366
00:13:59,098 --> 00:14:00,532
Whoopee flippin' ding, Winger.

368

It's the Jim Belushi
of sexual commitments.

369
00:14:04,602 --> 00:14:05,901
It barely means anything,

370
00:14:05,969 --> 00:14:07,603
and it grows on what's there over time.

371
00:14:07,671 --> 00:14:09,272
Boy, that guy's
really taking a pounding

372
00:14:09,339 --> 00:14:11,574
in this conversation.

373
00:14:11,641 --> 00:14:13,108

I really liked what we were doing.

376
00:14:23,451 --> 00:14:26,352
And if the ratio of work to pleasure

377
00:14:26,420 --> 00:14:27,954
can really stay at that same level,

378
00:14:28,021 --> 00:14:29,355
I don't care what it's called.

379
00:14:29,423 --> 00:14:33,125
I'll do it. Let's do it.

380
00:14:39,699 --> 00:14:41,866
Okay.

Okay.

We're all here to support you.

385
00:15:01,950 --> 00:15:03,284
Jeff even brought his girlfriend.

386
00:15:03,351 --> 00:15:05,185
Oh. She's his girlfriend now?

387
00:15:05,253 --> 00:15:06,986
Can't wait till he hears about it.

388
00:15:07,054 --> 00:15:08,221
Oh, he knows.

389
00:15:08,288 --> 00:15:10,189
They even had to file
paperwork with the Dean.

390
00:15:10,257 --> 00:15:12,791
It's pretty serious.

I have no idea

395
00:15:20,564 --> 00:15:24,331
how someone could do
what you're about to do.

[Background chatter]

397
00:15:26,834 --> 00:15:29,067
I brought goobers.
Anybody want a goober?

398
00:15:29,135 --> 00:15:30,668

Shh!

408

are dying from the tea?
