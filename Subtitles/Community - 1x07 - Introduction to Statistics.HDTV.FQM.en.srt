00:02:30,084 --> 00:02:31,651
The Bernoulli distribution

4
00:02:31,718 --> 00:02:33,050
is the number of successes

5
00:02:33,117 --> 00:02:34,617
in a sequence of independent

6
00:02:34,684 --> 00:02:36,850
yes-no experiments.

7
00:02:36,917 --> 00:02:38,217
Okay.

8
00:02:38,284 --> 00:02:39,351
Uh, for the Quiz Monday,

9
00:02:39,417 --> 00:02:45,117
brush up on chapters three and four.

10
00:02:45,184 --> 00:02:46,784
Bernoulli's one of my favorites.

11
00:02:46,850 --> 00:02:49,584
Little-known fact,
statistics were not his only love.

12
00:02:49,651 --> 00:02:51,084
He's also famous for his French sauce

13
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:52,117
used on meat and poultry.

14
00:02:52,184 --> 00:02:53,484
That's Bearnaise.

15
00:02:53,551 --> 00:02:55,250
Oh, we may need
to settle this at a restaurant.

16
00:02:55,317 --> 00:02:56,850
It's cute.

17
00:02:56,917 --> 00:02:58,284
A little aggressive,

18
00:02:58,351 --> 00:03:00,150
but as a busy,
confident woman of authority,

19
00:03:00,217 --> 00:03:01,617
I'm attracted to men who take charge.

20
00:03:01,684 --> 00:03:03,351
Are you being sarcastic,
or am I nailing it?

21
00:03:03,417 --> 00:03:05,250
You were nailing it,
until you had to ask.

22
00:03:05,317 --> 00:03:07,384
Oh, damn it. Starting over.

23
00:03:07,451 --> 00:03:08,850
Hey, you in the skirt, date me.

24
00:03:08,917 --> 00:03:09,917
I'd like to, Mr. Winger.

25
00:03:09,983 --> 00:03:11,050
You're tall, you dress nice,

26
00:03:11,117 --> 00:03:12,384
and I've graded enough of your tests

27
00:03:12,451 --> 00:03:14,084
to know I'd never feel
mentally inadequate.

28
00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:15,217
Thank you.

29
00:03:15,284 --> 00:03:17,150
Only problem, I don't date students.

30
00:03:20,617 --> 00:03:22,017
You know if you agree
to go out with me...

31
00:03:22,084 --> 00:03:23,017
Oh, hey.

32
00:03:23,084 --> 00:03:24,017
Awkward.

33
00:03:24,084 --> 00:03:25,217
How small is this campus?

34
00:03:25,284 --> 00:03:26,751
Bastard.

35
00:03:26,818 --> 00:03:28,451
It's fine. I don't care.

36
00:03:28,517 --> 00:03:29,883
It's disgusting the way men behave.

37
00:03:29,950 --> 00:03:31,651
Did you ever see that
Katherine Heigl movie poster

38
00:03:31,718 --> 00:03:33,584
where Gerard Butler had
that heart over his weiner?

39
00:03:33,651 --> 00:03:34,617
That resonated with me.

40
00:03:34,684 --> 00:03:35,617
Okay, fine.

41
00:03:35,684 --> 00:03:36,617
But just to repeat,

42
00:03:36,684 --> 00:03:37,651
I don't care what Jeff does.

43
00:03:37,718 --> 00:03:38,617
Bastard.

44
00:03:38,684 --> 00:03:39,651
I'm barely a student.

45
00:03:39,718 --> 00:03:40,651
I'm older than you.

46
00:03:40,718 --> 00:03:41,950
I drive a Lexus.

47
00:03:42,017 --> 00:03:43,184
I saw "Ghost Busters" in the theater.

48
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:44,684
Look, my gums are receding.

49
00:03:44,751 --> 00:03:47,451
It's uncanny how many
of my buttons you're finding,

50
00:03:47,517 --> 00:03:49,651
but I have a personal rule about this,
and I stick to it.

51
00:03:49,718 --> 00:03:51,784
Have a cup of coffee with me.
I bet I can change your mind.

52
00:03:51,850 --> 00:03:53,184
Oh, I know you can.

53
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:55,184
That's why you're not
getting the chance.

54
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:59,117
Ooh, whoo.

55
00:03:59,184 --> 00:04:01,584
Are you coming to my
Dias de los Muertos party?

56
00:04:01,651 --> 00:04:03,150
I'm definitely gonna try to swing by.

57
00:04:03,217 --> 00:04:05,117
Then I can mark you down
as definitely being there

58
00:04:05,184 --> 00:04:07,351
from 7:00 sharp till upside-down
Spanish question mark?

59
00:04:07,417 --> 00:04:09,050
- Here's the thing...
- No, here's the thing.

60
00:04:09,117 --> 00:04:10,651
I am putting my foot down.
You understand?

61
00:04:10,718 --> 00:04:12,617
I am being assertive,

62
00:04:12,684 --> 00:04:14,584
and I am making eye contact,

63
00:04:14,651 --> 00:04:16,484
and it is achieving results.

64
00:04:16,551 --> 00:04:17,850
Are you trying to get
formidable with me?

65
00:04:17,917 --> 00:04:18,917
It worked on Pierce.

66
00:04:18,983 --> 00:04:20,617
Infomercials work on Pierce.

67
00:04:20,684 --> 00:04:23,751
Jeff, you're the cool guy, okay?

68
00:04:23,818 --> 00:04:26,617
If you show up,
it'll be the first party I host

69
00:04:26,684 --> 00:04:27,950
where everyone doesn't say

70
00:04:28,017 --> 00:04:31,684
they need to get home
in time for the news.

71
00:04:31,751 --> 00:04:32,684
This won't work.

72
00:04:32,751 --> 00:04:33,850
The last time you did this,

73
00:04:33,917 --> 00:04:35,217
I saved a vial of your tears

74
00:04:35,284 --> 00:04:36,983
and have been slowly
building up an immunity.

75
00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:38,684
I was so unpopular in high school,

76
00:04:38,751 --> 00:04:41,250
the crossing guard used to
lure me into traffic.

77
00:04:41,317 --> 00:04:44,117
This party is a second chance

78
00:04:44,184 --> 00:04:45,551
to be...

79
00:04:45,617 --> 00:04:47,150
Hip.

80
00:04:47,217 --> 00:04:49,584
Cool!

81
00:04:49,651 --> 00:04:52,417
Laidback!

82
00:04:52,484 --> 00:04:53,983
Look, I will come to your party.

83
00:04:54,050 --> 00:04:55,584
Thank you.

84
00:04:55,651 --> 00:04:57,451
I'm putting you down for two bags of ice

85
00:04:57,517 --> 00:04:59,983
and a sleeve of paper cups.

86
00:05:14,084 --> 00:05:16,983
Taking a pill?

87
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:19,184
- Yes, I am.
- Xenolovaden.

88
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:20,850
My grandpa took that
when he was around your age.

89
00:05:20,917 --> 00:05:23,751
Fantastic.

90
00:05:23,818 --> 00:05:24,983
But by the time grandpa got up in years,

91
00:05:25,050 --> 00:05:26,517
his memory wasn't great.

92
00:05:26,584 --> 00:05:27,751
He'd mix the wrong pills.
You know how old people are?

93
00:05:27,818 --> 00:05:29,050
Heard stories about it, yeah.

94
00:05:29,117 --> 00:05:30,284
One time he started hallucinating

95
00:05:30,351 --> 00:05:31,718
and ran down the street
with no pants on.

96
00:05:31,784 --> 00:05:33,551
Which in the Gaza Strip
is considered a real party foul,

97
00:05:33,617 --> 00:05:35,117
so you should probably be careful...

98
00:05:35,184 --> 00:05:37,317
Look, I really don't need your advice,

99
00:05:37,384 --> 00:05:39,484
and I'm not your pantsless grandpa.

100
00:05:39,551 --> 00:05:42,917
Pantsless grandpa.

101
00:05:45,184 --> 00:05:46,351
Hola!

102
00:05:47,384 --> 00:05:48,718
Scary.

103
00:05:48,818 --> 00:05:51,317
Oh, cute! Cute.

104
00:05:51,384 --> 00:05:53,684
Oh, Britta.

105
00:05:53,751 --> 00:05:55,050
You look adorable.

106
00:05:55,117 --> 00:05:56,184
Thank you.

107
00:05:56,250 --> 00:05:57,850
I hate when women use Halloween

108
00:05:57,917 --> 00:05:59,484
as an excuse to dress up
like sluts, you know?

109
00:05:59,551 --> 00:06:02,250
Yeah.

110
00:06:02,317 --> 00:06:04,351
Okay, everyone.

111
00:06:04,417 --> 00:06:06,417
I think we can begin.

112
00:06:06,484 --> 00:06:09,417
I've got everyone's
personalized cookie tombstones,

113
00:06:09,484 --> 00:06:11,250
por tradicion,

114
00:06:11,317 --> 00:06:12,551
and in a few minutes,

115
00:06:12,617 --> 00:06:14,617
we're going to start
the dance of the dead...

116
00:06:14,684 --> 00:06:16,551
La danza de los muertos.

117
00:06:16,617 --> 00:06:18,084
You don't have to keep doing that!

118
00:06:18,150 --> 00:06:19,651
Party on.

119
00:06:26,551 --> 00:06:27,883
It's nice of you to be here.

120
00:06:27,950 --> 00:06:29,617
Sure you'd rather be out
with your hot professor.

121
00:06:29,684 --> 00:06:30,718
Well, it's funny,

122
00:06:30,784 --> 00:06:32,050
I enrolled here as selfish loner,

123
00:06:32,117 --> 00:06:33,317
but you and the group have given me

124
00:06:33,384 --> 00:06:34,651
a crash course in friendship.

125
00:06:34,718 --> 00:06:36,317
- She blew you off, huh?
- She's grading papers.

126
00:06:36,384 --> 00:06:37,684
Professor Slater?

127
00:06:37,751 --> 00:06:39,084
She's not grading papers.

128
00:06:39,150 --> 00:06:40,718
She's at the faculty party
in the cafeteria.

129
00:06:40,784 --> 00:06:42,718
Oh, look, it's the eavesdropping matador.

130
00:06:42,784 --> 00:06:45,617
Are you saying my people are sneaky?

131
00:06:45,684 --> 00:06:47,017
What?

132
00:06:47,084 --> 00:06:48,184
There's a storm

133
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:49,351
building on the horizon,

134
00:06:49,417 --> 00:06:51,050
but you and I will save the night.

135
00:06:51,117 --> 00:06:53,617
Chex mix, pretzels, baby carrots,

136
00:06:53,684 --> 00:06:57,784
predictable but appetizing.

137
00:06:57,850 --> 00:06:59,117
- Hey.
- Hey.

138
00:06:59,184 --> 00:07:01,050
Can I ask you something
I always wanted to ask

139
00:07:01,117 --> 00:07:03,217
- the real Batman?
- Yeah.

140
00:07:03,284 --> 00:07:04,484
Am I good looking?

141
00:07:04,551 --> 00:07:06,217
You're a very attractive young man.

142
00:07:06,284 --> 00:07:11,050
I knew it.

143
00:07:11,117 --> 00:07:13,284
Let's get this party started!

144
00:07:13,351 --> 00:07:14,684
Who are you?

145
00:07:14,751 --> 00:07:18,050
I am the Beastmaster.

146
00:07:18,117 --> 00:07:21,417
From the movie Beastmaster.

147
00:07:21,484 --> 00:07:23,417
What rock have you been living under?

148
00:07:23,484 --> 00:07:24,917
What are you going as?

149
00:07:24,983 --> 00:07:26,917
A gay douchebag? Just kidding.

150
00:07:26,983 --> 00:07:28,818
Nice one. I'm not much
of a costume guy.

151
00:07:28,883 --> 00:07:30,050
I know, you're not much

152
00:07:30,117 --> 00:07:31,584
of a liking the ladies guy either, huh?

153
00:07:31,651 --> 00:07:36,217
Oop. Body blow. Is that liquor?

154
00:07:36,284 --> 00:07:37,217
Hello.

155
00:07:37,284 --> 00:07:38,284
Here's your drinks, mates.

156
00:07:38,351 --> 00:07:39,284
Oh, thanks, Urkel.

157
00:07:39,351 --> 00:07:40,451
I'm Harry Potter.

158
00:07:40,517 --> 00:07:41,617
Really?

159
00:07:41,684 --> 00:07:44,217
What up, Urkel?

160
00:07:52,751 --> 00:07:54,150
Hey.

161
00:07:54,217 --> 00:07:56,284
Oh...

162
00:07:56,351 --> 00:07:58,484
All right. What are you taking?

163
00:07:59,983 --> 00:08:02,084
You know, the usual cool stuff.

164
00:08:02,150 --> 00:08:04,917
I've got 'ludes, uh, dreamers...

165
00:08:04,983 --> 00:08:05,950
Johnny boys.

166
00:08:06,017 --> 00:08:06,950
Tell you what.

167
00:08:07,017 --> 00:08:08,684
I'll trade you one of mine

168
00:08:08,751 --> 00:08:10,651
for two of yours. Hmm?

169
00:08:10,718 --> 00:08:12,950
I don't know, Star-Burns. I'm...

170
00:08:13,017 --> 00:08:14,250
Oh, sorry.

171
00:08:14,317 --> 00:08:15,950
I thought I was dealing
with the Beastmaster.

172
00:08:16,017 --> 00:08:19,718
Hey, hey, who said you weren't?

173
00:08:19,784 --> 00:08:22,017
Saddle up, fruit pie.

174
00:08:22,084 --> 00:08:24,384
I don't mind if I do, may I?

175
00:08:24,451 --> 00:08:27,217
Here. take this.

176
00:08:27,284 --> 00:08:29,484
Give anyone that shows up
their stupid credit.

177
00:08:29,551 --> 00:08:30,651
You going to the faculty party?

178
00:08:30,718 --> 00:08:31,684
Make me your plus one.

179
00:08:31,751 --> 00:08:32,850
Ah, give it up, Winger.

180
00:08:32,917 --> 00:08:35,551
Professor Slater doesn't date students.

181
00:08:35,617 --> 00:08:38,551
Or married Asians who drive Mopeds.

182
00:08:38,617 --> 00:08:41,317
Give you 20 bucks.

183
00:08:41,384 --> 00:08:43,484
I'll bring the hog around.

184
00:08:55,150 --> 00:08:57,217
Okay, it's time for the
"dance of the dead".

185
00:08:58,284 --> 00:09:00,217
Everyone form a circle.

186
00:09:00,284 --> 00:09:03,150
Lights. Music.

187
00:09:03,217 --> 00:09:06,718
Is it under genre or
on a specific playlist?

188
00:09:06,784 --> 00:09:08,818
Hey, uh, man?
What'd you slip me?

189
00:09:08,883 --> 00:09:12,150
I keep grinding my teeth,
and I want to kiss everybody.

190
00:09:12,217 --> 00:09:14,117
What'd you slip me, man?

191
00:09:14,184 --> 00:09:16,883
My heart stopped racing,
and I can't pee.

192
00:09:16,950 --> 00:09:19,050
Now for the first dance,

193
00:09:19,117 --> 00:09:22,217
I'd like to invite a very
special guest to the floor.

194
00:09:22,284 --> 00:09:24,517
Jeff Winger?

195
00:09:28,384 --> 00:09:29,950
Jeff?

196
00:09:30,017 --> 00:09:31,351
Where's Jeff?

197
00:09:38,451 --> 00:09:40,451
Is Jeff gone?

198
00:09:41,484 --> 00:09:43,284
You know, I'm gonna go.

199
00:09:43,351 --> 00:09:44,384
I don't want to miss the news.

200
00:09:44,451 --> 00:09:45,683
News!

201
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:48,151
He just stepped out.

202
00:09:48,217 --> 00:09:51,884
He's gonna be right back.

203
00:09:51,950 --> 00:09:54,584
He's going to the faculty party.

204
00:09:54,650 --> 00:09:56,050
To be with professor "short skirt"?

205
00:09:56,117 --> 00:09:57,284
We hate her.

206
00:09:57,351 --> 00:09:59,451
No, it's not about her, Shirley.

207
00:09:59,518 --> 00:10:01,417
I can't believe that
Jeff would do this to Annie.

208
00:10:01,484 --> 00:10:03,484
Yes, absolutely. It's about Annie.

209
00:10:03,551 --> 00:10:05,151
We should go find that bitch's car

210
00:10:05,217 --> 00:10:08,351
and snap off her antenna.

211
00:10:08,417 --> 00:10:10,251
It's like high school all over again.

212
00:10:10,317 --> 00:10:12,783
Everyone's leaving.

213
00:10:12,850 --> 00:10:14,518
Not me.

214
00:10:14,584 --> 00:10:17,618
I could do this all night.

215
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:28,434
There you go, pretty lady.

216
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:30,267
What are you doing here?

217
00:10:30,334 --> 00:10:32,000
Showing you my non-student side.

218
00:10:32,067 --> 00:10:33,867
I have to admit,
this outfit's doing it for me.

219
00:10:33,934 --> 00:10:35,467
I may or may not
have been deflowered

220
00:10:35,534 --> 00:10:36,900
by a junior rodeo champion.

221
00:10:36,967 --> 00:10:38,634
You're reminding me
of my first time too.

222
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:40,534
You lost your virginity to Robin Hood?

223
00:10:40,601 --> 00:10:42,334
No, with an attractive woman at a party.

224
00:10:42,401 --> 00:10:44,134
We seem destined to repeat history.

225
00:10:44,201 --> 00:10:46,000
I told you no students.
It's unseemly.

226
00:10:46,067 --> 00:10:47,601
I go out with you,
you tell your friends,

227
00:10:47,668 --> 00:10:49,234
- it gets around the school...
- What friends?

228
00:10:49,301 --> 00:10:50,334
I have no friends.

229
00:10:50,401 --> 00:10:51,934
I hate everyone here but you.

230
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,234
Hey.

231
00:10:53,301 --> 00:10:54,401
What are you doing here?

232
00:10:54,467 --> 00:10:55,767
What are you doing here?

233
00:10:55,867 --> 00:10:57,401
You should be over
at the library with Annie...

234
00:10:57,467 --> 00:10:58,934
Whoa.

235
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,534
Yippy ki yay.

236
00:11:01,601 --> 00:11:02,934
Thought you weren't a costume guy.

237
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,267
You had to have one
to get in here, Squirrel.

238
00:11:04,334 --> 00:11:05,800
Oh, so where did you get it?

239
00:11:05,867 --> 00:11:07,534
'Cause I wouldn't think
that any costume stores

240
00:11:07,601 --> 00:11:08,800
would be open this late.

241
00:11:08,867 --> 00:11:10,767
I don't know what you're getting at.

242
00:11:10,833 --> 00:11:12,167
I think the words that you're looking for

243
00:11:12,234 --> 00:11:13,601
are "I own a cowboy outfit."

244
00:11:13,668 --> 00:11:16,134
And it is tight too.
Did you buy it like that?

245
00:11:16,201 --> 00:11:18,201
Your toy gun to my head, I'd say yes.

246
00:11:18,267 --> 00:11:20,100
Hi. Michelle Slater, PHD.

247
00:11:20,167 --> 00:11:21,534
Britta Perry, GED.

248
00:11:21,601 --> 00:11:23,134
Oh, are you a classmate of Jeff's?

249
00:11:23,201 --> 00:11:24,568
Oh, well, when you say "classmate",

250
00:11:24,634 --> 00:11:26,467
It sounds like we take naps
together and eat paste,

251
00:11:26,534 --> 00:11:28,301
but what's great about
community colleges

252
00:11:28,367 --> 00:11:29,900
is that a lot of the students

253
00:11:29,967 --> 00:11:31,568
are just as mature as the teachers.

254
00:11:31,634 --> 00:11:33,934
Jeff, you must return to Annie's party.

255
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,434
She's feeling unpopular.

256
00:11:35,501 --> 00:11:38,367
Jeff, Pierce took something,
and he is tripping balls.

257
00:11:38,434 --> 00:11:40,534
He is touching people and dancing weird.

258
00:11:40,601 --> 00:11:42,568
it's like grumpy old men
but not hilarious.

259
00:11:42,634 --> 00:11:44,367
Okay, uh, guys?

260
00:11:44,434 --> 00:11:46,867
I'm at a grownup
Halloween party, all right?

261
00:11:46,934 --> 00:11:48,334
You're all being unseemly.

262
00:11:48,401 --> 00:11:50,700
- Oh, no.
- How are we unseemly?

263
00:11:50,767 --> 00:11:53,267
Why is Urkel ripping the antenna

264
00:11:53,334 --> 00:11:54,934
off professor Slater's car?

265
00:11:56,201 --> 00:11:58,067
That's right, professor Slim Calves.

266
00:11:58,134 --> 00:12:02,134
This is what you get when you
steal Jeff from a good woman!

267
00:12:05,034 --> 00:12:06,767
No, Abed!

268
00:12:16,034 --> 00:12:18,934
- Is he meowing?
- Yeah.

269
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,301
Enough. I want you guys out of here.

270
00:12:21,367 --> 00:12:23,501
Britta, I don't care about
your high school soap opera.

271
00:12:23,568 --> 00:12:27,067
Abed, you're not Batman.

272
00:12:27,134 --> 00:12:28,867
Pierce. Pierce. Pierce.

273
00:12:28,934 --> 00:12:31,401
Stop grinding on
the women's studies department.

274
00:12:31,467 --> 00:12:33,800
You are too old to be tripping.

275
00:12:33,867 --> 00:12:36,067
I'm old?

276
00:12:36,134 --> 00:12:39,833
What do you mean old?

277
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:43,301
Whose hands are these?

278
00:12:45,867 --> 00:12:46,833
Help me!

279
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:48,167
Way to go.

280
00:12:48,234 --> 00:12:49,767
I know I'm not Batman.

281
00:12:49,833 --> 00:12:51,967
You could try not being a jerk.

282
00:12:52,034 --> 00:12:56,034
She's pretty hot.

283
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:59,568
Well, where were we, little doggie?

284
00:12:59,634 --> 00:13:02,833
- Unseemly.
- Yeah. Crap.

285
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:09,434
Shirley?

286
00:13:13,067 --> 00:13:14,833
Shirley!

287
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:16,367
This is professor Robin Hood's office.

288
00:13:16,434 --> 00:13:17,800
So what are you doing?

289
00:13:17,867 --> 00:13:19,134
I'm putting this hose in her desk,

290
00:13:19,201 --> 00:13:20,334
and you going outside
to turn the water on.

291
00:13:20,401 --> 00:13:21,767
Why?

292
00:13:21,833 --> 00:13:24,267
To teach that long-neck
weave-having bank teller

293
00:13:24,334 --> 00:13:25,367
she can't steal another woman's man!

294
00:13:25,434 --> 00:13:27,267
That's why.

295
00:13:31,467 --> 00:13:34,134
I have a confession to make.

296
00:13:34,201 --> 00:13:35,534
I think some of what I just said

297
00:13:35,601 --> 00:13:37,534
may have more to do with my situation.

298
00:13:37,601 --> 00:13:39,367
Yeah, the long-neck,
weave-having bank teller

299
00:13:39,434 --> 00:13:41,434
didn't feel universal.

300
00:13:41,501 --> 00:13:43,900
My ex-husband came by this morning,

301
00:13:43,967 --> 00:13:47,201
and he, uh, he asked for his ring back.

302
00:13:47,267 --> 00:13:48,467
It was his mother's,

303
00:13:48,534 --> 00:13:51,167
and he wants to give it
to his new girlfriend.

304
00:13:51,234 --> 00:13:53,134
Shirley, that sucks.

305
00:13:53,201 --> 00:13:54,434
Don't get me wrong.

306
00:13:54,501 --> 00:13:56,234
Best thing ever happened to me
was him leaving.

307
00:13:56,301 --> 00:13:59,100
I just... I always thought
he'd come crawling back,

308
00:13:59,167 --> 00:14:03,267
and I'd get to tell him, "go to hell."

309
00:14:03,334 --> 00:14:04,733
He couldn't even give me that.

310
00:14:06,601 --> 00:14:08,833
You know what the crazy thing is, Britta?

311
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:12,467
Everything you've done tonight?

312
00:14:12,534 --> 00:14:15,434
It's like I was too proud
to admit I was hurt,

313
00:14:15,501 --> 00:14:17,668
so I had to pretend that you were.

314
00:14:17,733 --> 00:14:20,234
I totally get that.

315
00:14:20,301 --> 00:14:23,100
I feel better now.

316
00:14:23,167 --> 00:14:24,934
Let's go check on Annie.

317
00:14:29,367 --> 00:14:31,867
Can you believe
I targeted this poor lady?

318
00:14:31,934 --> 00:14:33,900
Look at all these awards.

319
00:14:33,967 --> 00:14:35,568
I bet she's nice.

320
00:14:35,634 --> 00:14:37,733
Yeah.

321
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:39,367
Nice and pretentious.

322
00:14:48,134 --> 00:14:49,067
Pierce?

323
00:14:49,134 --> 00:14:52,668
Pierce, are you okay?

324
00:14:52,733 --> 00:14:54,934
Hey, man, what's going on?

325
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,401
You have a full-on erection.

326
00:14:57,467 --> 00:14:59,134
Just rela... Just relax.

327
00:14:59,201 --> 00:15:02,934
Pierce, relax. Just relax, okay?

328
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,501
Pierce!

329
00:15:04,568 --> 00:15:09,134
You are too old to be tripping!

330
00:15:09,201 --> 00:15:11,700
Pierce...

331
00:15:11,767 --> 00:15:14,334
You are too old to be tripping.

332
00:15:14,401 --> 00:15:17,000
Tell me about the Beatles, Pierce.

333
00:15:17,067 --> 00:15:21,967
Tell me about Woodstock
and Sputnik, Pierce.

334
00:15:33,434 --> 00:15:35,267
Gee, do I feel a breeze here?

335
00:15:35,334 --> 00:15:37,268
Because someone just struck out.

336
00:15:37,333 --> 00:15:39,500
She blew you off too, Chang.

337
00:15:39,567 --> 00:15:40,934
Is that what you had to fall back on?

338
00:15:41,001 --> 00:15:43,300
Look at me, bro. Look at me.

339
00:15:43,367 --> 00:15:45,901
I've got the body
of a fifth grader, okay?

340
00:15:45,967 --> 00:15:47,534
If I was working with what you've got,

341
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,433
she'd be at the comfort inn right now

342
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:50,667
giving me a Mexican Halloween.

343
00:15:50,734 --> 00:15:51,667
It's this campus.

344
00:15:51,734 --> 00:15:53,333
It feeds on my coolness.

345
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:54,667
I... I got no moves anymore.

346
00:15:54,734 --> 00:15:56,101
Moves?

347
00:15:56,168 --> 00:15:58,367
Everything's a game to guys like you.

348
00:15:58,433 --> 00:16:02,034
I know one move I bet
you've never tried in your life.

349
00:16:02,101 --> 00:16:03,834
What is it?

350
00:16:12,934 --> 00:16:15,300
Please sleep with me. Please.

351
00:16:15,367 --> 00:16:17,534
Pretty please. I'm so lonely.

352
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,867
I haven't slept with anyone
in a very long time,

353
00:16:19,934 --> 00:16:21,134
and you are so good looking.

354
00:16:21,201 --> 00:16:23,834
Please do me the favor
of having sex with me.

355
00:16:28,567 --> 00:16:30,467
 Okay, stay three steps behind

356
00:16:30,534 --> 00:16:31,867
and promise you won't tell anybody.

357
00:16:31,934 --> 00:16:33,767
I promise.

358
00:16:33,834 --> 00:16:34,934
I promise.

359
00:16:47,367 --> 00:16:50,234
Everybody, stay out of the library.

360
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:52,967
Pierce, it's okay. Come out of there.

361
00:16:53,034 --> 00:16:54,934
No, I'm not ready to die!

362
00:16:55,001 --> 00:16:56,867
Pierce, you're not gonna die!

363
00:16:56,934 --> 00:16:58,901
Just... Just keep walking.
Don't make eye contact.

364
00:16:58,967 --> 00:17:01,400
Jeff. Jeff! Jeff.

365
00:17:01,467 --> 00:17:02,600
Pierce is freaking out.

366
00:17:02,667 --> 00:17:04,134
You're the only one that can help.

367
00:17:04,201 --> 00:17:05,300
What makes you think that?

368
00:17:05,367 --> 00:17:06,467
Is Jeff out there?

369
00:17:06,534 --> 00:17:07,700
He's the only one who can help.

370
00:17:07,767 --> 00:17:09,433
He says he's gonna kill himself,

371
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:10,767
but he doesn't want us to call 911,

372
00:17:10,834 --> 00:17:12,467
because he doesn't want
to get in trouble

373
00:17:12,534 --> 00:17:13,834
for taking drugs.

374
00:17:16,634 --> 00:17:20,801
I can't believe I'm doing this.

375
00:17:20,867 --> 00:17:24,067
I, uh...

376
00:17:24,134 --> 00:17:27,433
I think I have to say goodnight.

377
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:29,067
Are you, like,
a court-appointed guardian

378
00:17:29,134 --> 00:17:30,067
for these people?

379
00:17:30,134 --> 00:17:32,234
Uh, no.

380
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:34,901
Um, they're my classmates.

381
00:17:34,967 --> 00:17:37,134
Goodnight, Jeff.

382
00:17:42,567 --> 00:17:45,168
Loser!

383
00:17:53,134 --> 00:17:55,901
What in the Pink Floyd?

384
00:17:55,967 --> 00:17:57,634
I'm gonna crush myself to death

385
00:17:57,700 --> 00:17:59,767
with desks and tables, Jeff!

386
00:17:59,834 --> 00:18:02,201
Is that a death befitting a Beastmaster?

387
00:18:02,268 --> 00:18:04,067
I never saw Beastmaster.

388
00:18:04,134 --> 00:18:05,500
I just wanted to be cool.

389
00:18:05,567 --> 00:18:08,433
I'm coming in there, Pierce.

390
00:18:16,101 --> 00:18:18,500
Those floating
Mexican skeletons were right.

391
00:18:18,567 --> 00:18:19,767
My life is over.

392
00:18:19,834 --> 00:18:23,268
Well, when we go to floating skeletons

393
00:18:23,333 --> 00:18:24,734
with our problems,

394
00:18:24,801 --> 00:18:28,067
we get what we pay for, don't we?

395
00:18:28,168 --> 00:18:31,467
I'm old, Jeff.

396
00:18:31,534 --> 00:18:34,201
Pierce, I don't know how
you spent the first 60 years,

397
00:18:34,268 --> 00:18:36,767
but I know in the last two months

398
00:18:36,834 --> 00:18:38,867
you've probably doubled
the national average

399
00:18:38,934 --> 00:18:42,067
for amount of life lived per lifetime.

400
00:18:42,134 --> 00:18:45,700
well, I do have a young,
African-American friend.

401
00:18:45,767 --> 00:18:47,067
Yeah.

402
00:18:47,134 --> 00:18:48,400
And, more importantly,

403
00:18:48,467 --> 00:18:50,168
you're dressed like a gladiator

404
00:18:50,234 --> 00:18:52,600
in a desk fort that you
built during a bad trip.

405
00:18:52,667 --> 00:18:55,400
If life is just a series
of ridiculous attempts

406
00:18:55,467 --> 00:18:56,901
to be alive,

407
00:18:56,967 --> 00:18:58,700
you're a hero

408
00:18:58,767 --> 00:19:00,634
to everything that's ever lived.

409
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:02,367
Yeah?

410
00:19:02,433 --> 00:19:03,367
Yeah.

411
00:19:03,433 --> 00:19:05,634
Yeah!

412
00:19:24,867 --> 00:19:28,400
- Batman?
- Yeah?

413
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:31,001
Are you staying for the party?

414
00:19:31,067 --> 00:19:32,667
If I stay,

415
00:19:32,734 --> 00:19:36,201
there can be no party.

416
00:19:36,268 --> 00:19:39,001
I must be out there in the night,

417
00:19:39,067 --> 00:19:41,867
staying vigilant.

418
00:19:41,934 --> 00:19:43,734
Wherever a party needs to be saved,

419
00:19:43,801 --> 00:19:45,467
I'm there.

420
00:19:45,534 --> 00:19:47,767
Wherever there are masks,

421
00:19:47,834 --> 00:19:49,867
wherever there's tomfoolery and joy,

422
00:19:49,934 --> 00:19:53,500
I'm there.

423
00:19:53,567 --> 00:19:55,101
But sometimes I'm not,

424
00:19:55,168 --> 00:19:56,168
'cause I'm out in the night,

425
00:19:56,234 --> 00:19:58,268
staying vigilant, watching,

426
00:19:58,333 --> 00:20:01,300
lurking, running, jumping,

427
00:20:01,367 --> 00:20:03,967
hurtling, sleeping...

428
00:20:04,034 --> 00:20:05,567
No, I can't sleep.

429
00:20:05,634 --> 00:20:07,400
You sleep. I'm awake.

430
00:20:07,467 --> 00:20:09,500
I don't sleep. I don't blink.

431
00:20:10,734 --> 00:20:11,567
Am I a bird? No.

432
00:20:11,634 --> 00:20:14,101
I'm a bat.

433
00:20:14,168 --> 00:20:16,700
I am Batman.

434
00:20:16,767 --> 00:20:19,433
Or am I?

435
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:23,867
Yes, I am Batman.

436
00:20:23,934 --> 00:20:25,367
Happy Halloween.

437
00:20:30,201 --> 00:20:31,433
- I'm Batman.
- You sound like cookie monster.

438
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:34,001
- I'm Batman.
- That's Batman.

439
00:20:34,067 --> 00:20:36,567
Candy corn looks like tiny traffic cones.

440
00:20:36,634 --> 00:20:38,268
Yeah, it sure does.

441
00:20:38,333 --> 00:20:40,001
At, like, a candy traffic school.

442
00:20:41,433 --> 00:20:43,367
Like, a little gingerbread man
at the wheel,

443
00:20:43,433 --> 00:20:44,400
and he's drunk.

444
00:20:44,467 --> 00:20:45,400
Look out.

445
00:20:45,467 --> 00:20:46,700
You'd be driving,

446
00:20:46,767 --> 00:20:48,500
But you keep wanting to eat yourself.

447
00:20:48,567 --> 00:20:49,834
All day.

448
00:20:49,901 --> 00:20:51,168
That's one of my biggest fears.

449
00:20:51,234 --> 00:20:52,400
What is?

450
00:20:52,467 --> 00:20:54,234
If I ever, like, woke up as a donut.

451
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:55,201
You would eat yourself?

452
00:20:55,268 --> 00:20:56,767
I wouldn't even question it.

453
00:20:56,834 --> 00:20:57,901
That'd be tasty.

454
00:20:57,967 --> 00:21:00,433
It's cool to know other people

455
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:02,034
think about this stuff too.

456
00:21:02,101 --> 00:21:04,901
Yeah.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
