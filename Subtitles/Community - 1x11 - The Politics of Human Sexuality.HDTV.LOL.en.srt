2
00:00:04,069 --> 00:00:05,800
So I booked a sketch artist,
an improve troupe,

3
00:00:05,801 --> 00:00:07,692
and there'll be a laser
projecting a burning pelvis

4
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:08,726
onto the ceiling.	|Annie Dean

5
00:00:08,792 --> 00:00:10,192
A laser!

6
00:00:10,258 --> 00:00:11,459
Well, this isn't gonna be your mother's

7
00:00:11,525 --> 00:00:12,925
sexually transmitted disease
awareness fair.

8
00:00:14,392 --> 00:00:15,225
You've been quite
the little helper, Annie.	|Dean Annie

9
00:00:15,292 --> 00:00:16,925
Oh, STD fair, guys.

10
00:00:16,991 --> 00:00:19,759
Catch knowledge.	|Annie Troy Abed

11
00:00:25,425 --> 00:00:27,459
You think you're better than me?	|Troy Abed

12
00:00:27,525 --> 00:00:28,925
No.	|Abed Troy

13
00:00:28,991 --> 00:00:30,858
You stick to quotin' movie lines.

14
00:00:30,925 --> 00:00:32,325
I'll stick to sports.	|Troy Abed

15
00:00:32,392 --> 00:00:34,158
I'm trying to reduce
my pop-cultural referencing.	|Abed Troy

16
00:00:34,225 --> 00:00:36,759
Well, you're not moving into sports.

17
00:00:36,826 --> 00:00:39,891
You and I are playing
real basketball, right now.	|Troy Abed

18
00:00:39,958 --> 00:00:41,225
Sounds fun.	|Abed Troy

19
00:00:41,292 --> 00:00:44,525
No, it doesn't! And it won't be.	|Troy Abed

20
00:00:44,592 --> 00:00:46,891
- Catch knowledge.	|Annie Jeff Britta
- Sorry, not interested...	|Jeff Annie

21
00:00:46,958 --> 00:00:49,692
in ignoring your very important cause.

22
00:00:49,759 --> 00:00:51,225
Hi, I'm Jeff Winger.	|Jeff Secretary

23
00:00:51,292 --> 00:00:53,726
Oh, Sabrina is my new secretary.	|Dean Jeff

24
00:00:53,792 --> 00:00:56,392
"Secretary" is a little
degrading to women.	|Secretary Dean

25
00:00:56,459 --> 00:00:58,125
I help the dean do officey things.	|Secretary Jeff

26
00:00:58,192 --> 00:01:00,025
Oh, gender saved.	|Britta Secretary

27
00:01:00,092 --> 00:01:02,359
My casual friend and I are gonna have

28
00:01:02,425 --> 00:01:04,826
a non-romantic breakfast
if you'd like to join us.	|Jeff Secretary

29
00:01:04,891 --> 00:01:05,925
The cafeteria's closed
while we set up for the fair.

30
00:01:05,991 --> 00:01:07,092
Fortune cookie?	|Annie Jeff

31
00:01:07,158 --> 00:01:08,726
Isn't it great?

32
00:01:08,792 --> 00:01:10,459
Greendale is the latest
campus to catch a case

33
00:01:10,525 --> 00:01:12,058
of public health fever!	|Dean Jeff Britta

34
00:01:12,125 --> 00:01:13,991
You know the toilets
in the women's bathrooms

35
00:01:14,058 --> 00:01:15,125
don't have seats, right?	|Britta Dean

36
00:01:15,192 --> 00:01:18,092
Because they keep getting stolen.	|Dean Britta

37
00:01:18,158 --> 00:01:19,492
Sabrina, take a note.

38
00:01:19,559 --> 00:01:21,726
I want hidden cameras in every stall.	|Dean Secretary

39
00:01:21,792 --> 00:01:24,225
Problem solved.	|Britta Annie Jeff

40
00:01:24,292 --> 00:01:28,258
- "You will get aids."	|Jeff
- Flip it over.	|Annie Jeff

41
00:01:28,325 --> 00:01:30,025
"Unless you go to the STD fair."	|Jeff

42
00:01:30,092 --> 00:01:31,692
I wrote that.	|Annie Jeff

43
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:34,325
Congratu... horrible!	|Jeff Annie

44
00:01:34,392 --> 00:01:38,991
See you later.	|Annie Jeff

45
00:01:45,158 --> 00:01:47,991
Jeff... you and I are friends, right?	|Pierce Jeff

46
00:01:48,058 --> 00:01:49,692
Okay.	|Jeff Pierce

47
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:52,891
You may have noticed a
recent change in my demeanor.	|Pierce Jeff

48
00:01:52,958 --> 00:01:54,158
I haven't.	|Jeff Pierce

49
00:01:54,225 --> 00:01:55,891
Well, I have a new girlfriend.

50
00:01:55,958 --> 00:01:59,925
And she is super smart,
if you know what I mean.	|Pierce Jeff

51
00:01:59,991 --> 00:02:01,891
Unfortunately, I always
know what you mean.	|Jeff Pierce

52
00:02:01,958 --> 00:02:03,092
Can't wait for you to meet her.

53
00:02:03,158 --> 00:02:05,125
You know, when you catch a big fish,

54
00:02:05,192 --> 00:02:08,559
you want to stuff her
and put her on the mantle.

55
00:02:08,625 --> 00:02:11,025
How 'bout tonight?	|Pierce Jeff
I doubt it.	|Jeff Pierce

56
00:02:11,092 --> 00:02:12,759
Troy and I played basketball.
It was fun.	|Abed Jeff Pierce

57
00:02:12,826 --> 00:02:14,158
Don't gloat.

58
00:02:14,225 --> 00:02:15,692
It's impossible to guard you.

59
00:02:15,759 --> 00:02:18,925
Your eyes are too gentle and mysterious.	|Troy Abed

60
00:02:18,991 --> 00:02:20,759
Hey, guys, Jeff and I are
double-dating tonight

61
00:02:20,826 --> 00:02:22,559
with my new girlfriend.	|Pierce Group

62
00:02:22,625 --> 00:02:24,058
Ooh...	|Shirley Pierce

63
00:02:24,125 --> 00:02:26,125
You got that from "I doubt it"?	|Jeff Pierce

64
00:02:26,192 --> 00:02:27,925
Pierce has got a girlfriend!	|Shirley Pierce

65
00:02:27,991 --> 00:02:30,058
That's great. What does she do?	|Britta Pierce

66
00:02:30,125 --> 00:02:32,991
- She's an escort.	|	Pierce Group
- Oh...	|Shirley Pierce

67
00:02:33,058 --> 00:02:34,925
Some mysteries solve
themselves, don't they?	|Jeff Group

68
00:02:34,991 --> 00:02:36,625
No, no, no, that's just her profession.

69
00:02:36,692 --> 00:02:38,826
She doesn't escort me. No, no.

70
00:02:38,891 --> 00:02:40,792
I met her in my marketing class.

71
00:02:40,858 --> 00:02:43,891
And I'm taking Doreen
to Annie's mixer tonight.	|Pierce Group

72
00:02:43,958 --> 00:02:46,392
You mean the STD fair.
Catch knowledge.	|Pierce

73
00:02:46,459 --> 00:02:48,726
Taking a call girl to an STD fair.

74
00:02:48,792 --> 00:02:50,292
There's a joke here.	|Troy

75
00:02:50,359 --> 00:02:51,958
So, Jeff, dust off that black book

76
00:02:52,025 --> 00:02:53,392
and rustle up a honey, huh?	|Pierce Jeff

77
00:02:53,459 --> 00:02:57,025
Is there a pill that makes
the word "no" clearer?	|Jeff Pierce

78
00:02:57,092 --> 00:02:58,592
Well, I guess it is pretty short notice.

79
00:02:58,659 --> 00:02:59,826
Probably couldn't get a date anyway.	|Pierce Jeff

80
00:02:59,891 --> 00:03:03,392
- Oooohh...	|Group
- I'm sure you're right.	|Jeff Pierce

81
00:03:03,459 --> 00:03:05,826
Oooohh...	|Group

82
00:03:05,891 --> 00:03:07,258
Maybe it has something to do with crabs.

83
00:03:07,325 --> 00:03:09,392
They're like a food,
but they're also a disease.	|Troy

84
00:03:09,459 --> 00:03:11,292
You know, I wonder, Jeffrey,
for all your feather flashing,

85
00:03:11,359 --> 00:03:13,325
when was the last time
you actually scored?	|Pierce Jff

86
00:03:13,392 --> 00:03:14,891
Well, I don't know the
precise date, Pierce,

87
00:03:14,958 --> 00:03:17,625
because I'm not you,
so there's no receipt.	|Jeff Pierce

88
00:03:17,692 --> 00:03:19,092
Ooohh...	|Jeff Group

89
00:03:19,158 --> 00:03:20,058
Meh...	|Group Jeff

90
00:03:20,125 --> 00:03:21,559
Oh, come on.	|Jeff Group

91
00:03:21,625 --> 00:03:23,525
Jeff, you shouldn't take
potshots at some poor woman

92
00:03:23,592 --> 00:03:25,092
just because you can't get a date.	|Shirley Jeff

93
00:03:25,158 --> 00:03:27,991
I can get dates anytime I want.	|Jeff Shirley

94
00:03:28,058 --> 00:03:29,025
What is this, some kind of joke?	|Jeff Group

95
00:03:29,092 --> 00:03:31,692
No. This is.

96
00:03:31,759 --> 00:03:35,759
"Don't eat the crab dip."
Yay-yay!	|Troy Group

97
00:03:35,826 --> 00:03:38,125
Ah... You hear that, Annie?

98
00:03:38,192 --> 00:03:40,225
That's the sound of STDs screaming,

99
00:03:40,292 --> 00:03:42,592
"No! Stop being so aware of us!"

100
00:03:42,659 --> 00:03:44,258
Aah!

101
00:03:44,325 --> 00:03:45,991
And it's all thanks to you.	|Dean Annie

102
00:03:46,058 --> 00:03:49,092
I was voted most likely to
succeed at my rehab clinic.	|Annie Dean

103
00:03:49,158 --> 00:03:52,158
Well, in recognition
of all your hard work,

104
00:03:52,225 --> 00:03:54,792
I have decided that you should conduct

105
00:03:54,858 --> 00:03:56,325
the condom demonstration.

106
00:03:56,392 --> 00:03:59,659
You're gonna be center
stage showing everyone

107
00:03:59,726 --> 00:04:02,058
how to put a condom on a, well,

108
00:04:02,125 --> 00:04:03,925
what my dad called a Jimmy Carter.	|Dean Annie

109
00:04:03,991 --> 00:04:07,792
Um, I don't know if I'm
the right person for that.	|Annie Dean

110
00:04:07,858 --> 00:04:09,192
Don't worry, not a real one.

111
00:04:09,258 --> 00:04:11,625
No, it's an anatomically
correct model, you know.

112
00:04:11,692 --> 00:04:15,092
But trust me, eyes closed,
you can't tell the difference.

113
00:04:15,158 --> 00:04:17,125
Okay.	|Dean Annie

114
00:04:25,392 --> 00:04:27,726
Hey, it's Jeff Winger.

115
00:04:27,792 --> 00:04:32,192
Well, I wanted to see what
you were doing tonight.

116
00:04:32,258 --> 00:04:33,858
What do you mean, do I know your name?

117
00:04:33,925 --> 00:04:34,925
What kind of a question is that?

118
00:04:34,991 --> 00:04:37,092
Of course I know.

119
00:04:37,158 --> 00:04:39,058
Well, if I answer now,

120
00:04:39,125 --> 00:04:42,158
you'll never learn a
valuable lesson about trust,

121
00:04:42,225 --> 00:04:44,125
Jennifer.	|Jeff Extra

122
00:04:44,192 --> 00:04:46,025
Crap! Ahh...	|Jeff

123
00:04:46,092 --> 00:04:49,492
Pierce really got to you, huh?	|Britta Jeff

124
00:04:49,559 --> 00:04:51,258
It has been a dry spell.

125
00:04:51,325 --> 00:04:52,726
But that's only because it's
been a while since I've tried.

126
00:04:52,792 --> 00:04:54,292
So I'm trying.	|Jeff Britta

127
00:04:54,359 --> 00:04:55,891
Yeah, I can see that.

128
00:04:55,958 --> 00:04:58,192
This is a lot of outgoing calls.

129
00:04:58,258 --> 00:05:02,292
"Car wash redhead. Tube top,
REM Concert."

130
00:05:02,359 --> 00:05:04,925
"Juror number six."
That sounds aboveboard.

131
00:05:04,991 --> 00:05:06,058
At least you have "mommy" in here.

132
00:05:06,125 --> 00:05:07,525
It's not my mom.	|Jeff Britta

133
00:05:07,592 --> 00:05:09,826
Dude, not cool.	|Britta Jeff

134
00:05:09,891 --> 00:05:12,325
You saying "dude" is not cool.

135
00:05:12,392 --> 00:05:13,925
What are you doing?	|Jeff Britta

136
00:05:13,991 --> 00:05:15,925
Heh!

137
00:05:15,991 --> 00:05:18,058
"Hot blonde, Spanish class"?	|Britta Jeff

138
00:05:18,125 --> 00:05:20,058
You're welcome.	|Jeff Britta

139
00:05:20,125 --> 00:05:21,625
This is the phone book
of a man in his 20s.

140
00:05:21,692 --> 00:05:23,858
The women literally have no identities.

141
00:05:23,925 --> 00:05:25,459
It's pretty shallow.	|Britta Jeff

142
00:05:25,525 --> 00:05:27,726
You're right.

143
00:05:27,792 --> 00:05:29,991
I can't believe I haven't
seen it before now.	|Jeff Britta

144
00:05:30,058 --> 00:05:31,325
Whatever.

145
00:05:31,392 --> 00:05:33,192
I'm gonna go study with Shirley.	|Britta Jeff

146
00:05:33,258 --> 00:05:35,826
Well, I'll be here...
Rethinking my way of life.	|Jeff Britta

147
00:05:35,891 --> 00:05:37,792
Mm.	|Britta Jeff

148
00:05:40,759 --> 00:05:43,092
Call mommy.	|Jeff Britta

149
00:05:43,158 --> 00:05:46,759
Guys... I have a problem.

150
00:05:46,826 --> 00:05:48,459
The dean wants me to demonstrate

151
00:05:48,525 --> 00:05:51,092
the proper use of a
condom at the stupid fair

152
00:05:51,158 --> 00:05:53,192
by putting one on a
mannequin's stupid...

153
00:05:53,258 --> 00:05:55,292
Thingamabob.

154
00:05:55,359 --> 00:05:58,025
It's a big honor...

155
00:05:58,092 --> 00:05:59,425
But I'm gonna screw it up.	|Annie Britta Shirley

156
00:05:59,492 --> 00:06:01,392
Well, it's easy enough to practice.	|Shirley Annie

157
00:06:01,459 --> 00:06:02,891
Britta, do you have a banana?	|Shirley Britta

158
00:06:02,958 --> 00:06:06,759
This is an anatomically
correct model I'll be handling.

159
00:06:06,826 --> 00:06:10,425
Real... whatchamacallits...
are nothing like bananas!

160
00:06:10,492 --> 00:06:11,792
Are they?	|Annie Britta Shirley

161
00:06:11,858 --> 00:06:14,625
Have you never seen one?	|Britta Annie

162
00:06:14,692 --> 00:06:16,425
- Shh!	|Annie Britta
- Annie...

163
00:06:16,492 --> 00:06:18,158
being a virgin in this day and age

164
00:06:18,225 --> 00:06:19,425
is something to be proud of.

165
00:06:19,492 --> 00:06:20,459
You're like a unicorn.	|Shirley Annie

166
00:06:20,525 --> 00:06:23,925
I am not a unicorn.

167
00:06:23,991 --> 00:06:26,858
I had relations with my
high school boyfriend.

168
00:06:26,925 --> 00:06:29,125
We did it to Madonna's erotica

169
00:06:29,192 --> 00:06:30,592
on the floor of his walk-in closet.

170
00:06:30,659 --> 00:06:33,125
But he wouldn't let me look at it.

171
00:06:33,192 --> 00:06:36,692
And he cried after. And during.

172
00:06:36,759 --> 00:06:38,525
He's gay now.	|Annie Shirley Britta

173
00:06:38,592 --> 00:06:40,025
I think he was gay then.	|Britta Annie

174
00:06:40,092 --> 00:06:42,659
So you, uh, you never seen
one when you were growing up?

175
00:06:42,726 --> 00:06:44,592
Like, you know, on the
Internet, in a picture,

176
00:06:44,659 --> 00:06:45,858
or Harvey Keitel's?	|Shirley Annie

177
00:06:45,925 --> 00:06:47,425
I've caught glimpses,

178
00:06:47,492 --> 00:06:50,192
but I've never got a
real good look at one.

179
00:06:50,258 --> 00:06:53,659
What I need to do is
practice on the actual model,

180
00:06:53,726 --> 00:06:55,392
but the dean has it
locked in his office.	|Annie Shirley Britta

181
00:06:55,459 --> 00:06:56,759
Okay, that's easy enough.

182
00:06:56,826 --> 00:06:57,991
We'll go to him
and we'll ask him...	|Britta Annie

183
00:06:58,058 --> 00:07:01,158
No! This is really embarrassing.

184
00:07:01,225 --> 00:07:02,692
I don't want anyone to know.

185
00:07:02,759 --> 00:07:03,692
I just want to figure out how to do it

186
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:05,425
and get it over with.

187
00:07:05,492 --> 00:07:07,459
The dean is counting on me,

188
00:07:07,525 --> 00:07:10,925
and I want him to know that
I'm someone he can trust.

189
00:07:10,991 --> 00:07:14,826
We have to break into his office.	|Annie Britta Shirley

190
00:07:14,891 --> 00:07:16,392
I actually have no problem with that.	|Shirley Britta Annie

191
00:07:16,459 --> 00:07:17,891
I think I could do that. Mm-hmm.	|Britta Annie

192
00:07:22,792 --> 00:07:24,925
- Oh, hello, Jeffrey.	|Pierce Jeff
- Hi, Pierce.	|Jeff Pierce

193
00:07:24,991 --> 00:07:26,625
I was just going into the fair

194
00:07:26,692 --> 00:07:29,359
to wait for my smokin'-hot date.	|Pierce Jeff

195
00:07:29,425 --> 00:07:31,158
- That's nice.	|Jeff Pierce
- How 'bout you?

196
00:07:31,225 --> 00:07:33,058
Were you ever able to, you know,

197
00:07:33,125 --> 00:07:35,025
come up with a, you know, date?	|Pierce Jeff

198
00:07:35,092 --> 00:07:37,492
No, no. Because I didn't try.

199
00:07:37,559 --> 00:07:40,292
Because taking a date to
an STD fair would be lame.	 |Jeff Pierce

200
00:07:40,359 --> 00:07:41,858
Don't worry about it, kid.

201
00:07:41,925 --> 00:07:43,525
What you're going
through is a dry spell.

202
00:07:43,592 --> 00:07:45,325
From my experience,
they don't last any more

203
00:07:45,392 --> 00:07:48,425
than 12, 13 years.	|Pierce Jeff

204
00:07:48,492 --> 00:07:49,692
Excuse me.	|Pierce Jeff

205
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:51,025
Step right up.

206
00:07:51,092 --> 00:07:53,759
Get a prize, not an STD.

207
00:07:53,826 --> 00:07:55,925
Oh, no, syphilis.

208
00:07:55,991 --> 00:07:58,325
Please, please, no, syphilis.

209
00:07:58,392 --> 00:08:00,759
Ow, it burns!
Oh, that's gonna hurt.	|Dean Extra

210
00:08:00,826 --> 00:08:03,425
Gross. Dean, your assistant.

211
00:08:03,492 --> 00:08:05,359
Is she single?
What are her likes and dislikes?	|Jeff Dean

212
00:08:05,425 --> 00:08:06,925
Uh, yes on single.

213
00:08:06,991 --> 00:08:08,958
She likes hip-hop and horses.

214
00:08:09,025 --> 00:08:11,025
Dislikes beards and... yeah,
I was done talking.	|Dean Jeff

215
00:08:14,158 --> 00:08:18,958
Is it me, or are horses the
most beautiful creatures?

216
00:08:19,025 --> 00:08:20,525
They're so majestic.	|Jeff Secretary

217
00:08:20,592 --> 00:08:22,325
Totally.	|Secretary Jeff

218
00:08:22,392 --> 00:08:23,459
I mean, just this morning
when I was shaving

219
00:08:23,525 --> 00:08:25,158
and listening to the new Jay-Z,

220
00:08:25,225 --> 00:08:26,958
I was thinking about
how I want to squeeze in

221
00:08:27,025 --> 00:08:28,092
a quick gallop this weekend.	|Jeff Secretary

222
00:08:28,158 --> 00:08:29,592
Do you own a horse?	|Secretary Jeff

223
00:08:29,659 --> 00:08:33,225
Can you ever really own a horse?	|Jeff Secretary

224
00:08:37,625 --> 00:08:38,559
Pierce.	|Jeff Pierce
Yeah.	|Pierce Jeff

225
00:08:38,625 --> 00:08:39,826
This is Sabrina.

226
00:08:39,891 --> 00:08:41,692
About 30 seconds after you walked away,

227
00:08:41,759 --> 00:08:42,958
I asked her to be my date for the fair,

228
00:08:43,025 --> 00:08:44,225
and she said yes.	|Jeff Pierce

229
00:08:44,292 --> 00:08:46,192
Oh, you must have a great personality.	|Pierce Jeff

230
00:08:46,258 --> 00:08:47,592
Thank you.	|Secretary Pierce

231
00:08:47,659 --> 00:08:48,726
Congratulations, Jeff.
You proved me wrong.

232
00:08:48,792 --> 00:08:50,958
You got a girl.	|Pierce Jeff
Yeah, I did.	|Jeff Pierce

233
00:08:51,025 --> 00:08:53,858
Oh, this is Doreen.
Ready for our double date?	|Pierce Jeff

234
00:08:53,925 --> 00:08:57,492
Yes, I am. Wait, how'd you do that?	|Jeff Pierce

235
00:09:00,272 --> 00:09:02,773
Is this the best safe sex fair or what?

236
00:09:02,839 --> 00:09:04,472
Check out these condoms.

237
00:09:04,539 --> 00:09:07,040
All along the side it says "Greendale"!

238
00:09:07,106 --> 00:09:09,472
Exclamation point, my idea.	|Dean Chang

239
00:09:10,973 --> 00:09:16,406
Wow, me in a dune buggy.
With syphilis.

240
00:09:16,472 --> 00:09:17,706
This is going on the fridge.	|Jeff Pierce

241
00:09:17,773 --> 00:09:20,639
Hey, look how gorgeous
Doreen is tonight.

242
00:09:20,706 --> 00:09:22,773
Hey, can we...

243
00:09:22,839 --> 00:09:26,673
Let's lay out our plans for the evening.

244
00:09:26,739 --> 00:09:28,906
You wing man me, I wing man you.

245
00:09:28,973 --> 00:09:31,839
Maybe we split up for a little hoo-ha.

246
00:09:31,906 --> 00:09:36,939
And then meet in the morning
for eggs and... details.	|Pierce Jeff

247
00:09:37,006 --> 00:09:40,639
That sounds like the worst
combination plate ever.	|Jeff Pierce

248
00:09:42,106 --> 00:09:46,205
Ugh! I can't believe you beat me again!	|Troy Abed

249
00:09:46,272 --> 00:09:50,305
- You want my stuffed animal?	|Abed Troy
- Aah!

250
00:09:50,372 --> 00:09:53,606
We're arm wrestling. Ugh!	|Troy Abed

251
00:09:53,673 --> 00:09:54,773
Oh, like Stallone in over the top.

252
00:09:54,839 --> 00:09:56,140
But I'm not sure of all the rules.

253
00:09:56,205 --> 00:09:57,339
Don't I need a semi truck
and a ten-year-old son?	|Abed Troy

254
00:09:57,406 --> 00:10:01,706
The rules are you suck! Let's go!	|Troy Abed

255
00:10:01,773 --> 00:10:03,106
Uh, I want to wait for
a more inspiring song.

256
00:10:03,172 --> 00:10:04,506
This score isn't right.

257
00:10:04,572 --> 00:10:06,673
There we go.	|Abed Troy

258
00:10:26,339 --> 00:10:28,673
Aah!

259
00:10:39,006 --> 00:10:40,973
You broke my hand, you bastard.	|Troy Abed

260
00:10:56,205 --> 00:10:58,572
I can't do anything with this.	|Britta Shirley

261
00:10:58,639 --> 00:11:02,040
Hmm, let me see that.

262
00:11:02,106 --> 00:11:04,572
Ooh, I can see through the door.

263
00:11:04,639 --> 00:11:08,140
Oh, yeah. Thar she blows.	|Shirley Britta Annie

264
00:11:08,205 --> 00:11:10,040
Ooh, I wanna see! I wanna see!	|Britta Shirley

265
00:11:10,106 --> 00:11:11,073
- Okay, go, go, go.	|Shirley Britta
- Shh.	|Annie Britta

266
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:13,706
Oh!	|Britta

267
00:11:13,773 --> 00:11:14,973
I'm the one that needs to see.	|Annie Britta Shirley

268
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:18,172
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.	|Britta Annie

269
00:11:18,239 --> 00:11:19,572
It's okay.	|Shirley Annie

270
00:11:23,673 --> 00:11:25,673
Oh, boy.

271
00:11:27,406 --> 00:11:31,205
Oh, I had it wroooong!

272
00:11:31,272 --> 00:11:33,106
Is that considered large?	|Annie Britta Shirley

273
00:11:33,172 --> 00:11:34,673
- Yes.	|Britta Annie
- No.	|Shirley Annie

274
00:11:37,239 --> 00:11:41,606
What in the reverse
porky's is going on here?	|Security Annie Britta Shirley

275
00:11:41,673 --> 00:11:45,372
You know, Doreen speaks six languages.

276
00:11:45,439 --> 00:11:47,439
You should hear her
order wine in French.	|Pierce Jeff

277
00:11:47,506 --> 00:11:50,606
Hey, honey, say caber-net
sauv-a-gong-da-nun.	|Pierce Doreen

278
00:11:50,673 --> 00:11:52,272
Pierce, you're embarrassing me.	|Doreen Pierce

279
00:11:52,339 --> 00:11:54,372
Do you know a lot about wine?	|Jeff Doreen

280
00:11:54,439 --> 00:11:57,073
Well, I did have a client
who owned a vineyard in Napa.

281
00:11:57,140 --> 00:11:59,539
He was into S&M and Merlot,

282
00:11:59,606 --> 00:12:02,172
so we called it S&M&M.	|Doreen Jeff

283
00:12:02,239 --> 00:12:06,106
Honey, you're boring
the crap out of Jeff.	|Pierce Doreen

284
00:12:06,172 --> 00:12:09,873
Be right back.
I have to make tinkles.	|Secretary Jeff

285
00:12:09,939 --> 00:12:12,773
Well, then, I'm gonna go
get us another round.	|Pierce Jeff Doreen

286
00:12:12,839 --> 00:12:16,673
You know, you are not what I expected.

287
00:12:16,739 --> 00:12:18,506
You're smart, you're classy.

288
00:12:18,572 --> 00:12:19,639
You're not wearing go-go boots.	|Jeff Doreen

289
00:12:19,706 --> 00:12:22,372
They're in the shop.

290
00:12:22,439 --> 00:12:23,806
You know, despite
what most people think,

291
00:12:23,873 --> 00:12:27,272
I actually spend most
of my time talking.

292
00:12:27,339 --> 00:12:29,773
As men get older,
they want to spend their time

293
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:31,706
with someone they can have
a real conversation with.	|Doreen Jeff

294
00:12:31,773 --> 00:12:33,372
That is going to suck.	|Jeff Doreen

295
00:12:33,439 --> 00:12:35,639
"Going to", Jeff?

296
00:12:35,706 --> 00:12:37,006
Look, Sabrina's cute,

297
00:12:37,073 --> 00:12:39,939
but she thinks that Monty Python
is the evil snake

298
00:12:40,006 --> 00:12:41,272
from Harry Potter.	|Doreen Jeff

299
00:12:41,339 --> 00:12:44,040
Trust me, I know girls
I can converse with

300
00:12:44,106 --> 00:12:45,572
who are way more annoying.

301
00:12:45,639 --> 00:12:48,606
I will take "tinkles" over
"we need to talk" every time.	|Jeff Doreen

302
00:12:48,673 --> 00:12:50,472
Hey, babe.

303
00:12:50,539 --> 00:12:52,406
Ready to show me that Lexus?	|Secretary Jeff

304
00:12:52,472 --> 00:12:56,739
I thought you'd never ask.	|Jeff Secretary

305
00:12:56,806 --> 00:13:00,339
Doreen... it was very nice to meet you.	|Jeff Doreen

306
00:13:00,406 --> 00:13:02,106
You can do better.	|Doreen Jeff

307
00:13:09,305 --> 00:13:11,539
Here. Rrrrr...

308
00:13:11,606 --> 00:13:13,739
Oh, they already left?
What a couple of nincompoops!

309
00:13:13,806 --> 00:13:17,406
Uh, before I buy dinner,
I have to ask...

310
00:13:17,472 --> 00:13:20,272
is there any lovemaking on the table?	|Pierce Doreen

311
00:13:20,339 --> 00:13:22,939
We're through, Pierce.

312
00:13:23,006 --> 00:13:24,140
I'm gonna go to the bar,

313
00:13:24,205 --> 00:13:26,205
and you can join me if you'd like.

314
00:13:26,272 --> 00:13:28,639
And we can still have a lovely evening.

315
00:13:28,706 --> 00:13:31,328
But it will cost you 200 bucks.	|Doreen Pierce

316
00:13:38,468 --> 00:13:40,234
That is a pretty big discount.	|Pierce Extra

317
00:13:56,519 --> 00:13:59,686
I had no idea alcohol
would make people horny.

318
00:13:59,752 --> 00:14:01,752
Makes me sleepy. I don't...	|Dean

319
00:14:01,819 --> 00:14:03,185
- Dean.	|Security Dean
- Yeah.	|Dean Security

320
00:14:03,252 --> 00:14:05,619
We have a 597 currently
going on in your office.	|Security Dean

321
00:14:05,686 --> 00:14:07,185
A 597?

322
00:14:07,252 --> 00:14:10,853
There's a dog-fighting
ring in my office?	|Dean Security

323
00:14:10,919 --> 00:14:13,552
Okay, I'm just gonna turn him around,

324
00:14:13,619 --> 00:14:15,085
and we're gonna cover him up.

325
00:14:15,152 --> 00:14:18,886
Okay, ladies, I am shocked
at the reverse porky's

326
00:14:18,953 --> 00:14:20,085
that has happened here tonight.	|Dean Annie Britta Shirley

327
00:14:20,152 --> 00:14:21,452
I don't see what the big deal is.

328
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:23,919
Annie just needed to look
at the model of the pe...	|Britta Dean

329
00:14:23,985 --> 00:14:27,319
Oh, okay, the "p" word
has entered into play.

330
00:14:27,385 --> 00:14:29,452
That's exactly why I wanted Gail,

331
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:30,985
our school counselor, here,

332
00:14:31,052 --> 00:14:33,118
and Monique, who's keeping record,

333
00:14:33,185 --> 00:14:35,185
to ensure we discuss
these sensitive topics

334
00:14:35,252 --> 00:14:36,786
in a legally appropriate manner.	|Dean All

335
00:14:36,853 --> 00:14:39,018
I think everyone should say penis

336
00:14:39,085 --> 00:14:41,886
so we can take away the
negative power of the word.

337
00:14:41,953 --> 00:14:43,652
Yeah? So, everybody...	|Gail All

338
00:14:43,719 --> 00:14:44,786
Penis.	|All

339
00:14:44,853 --> 00:14:46,152
She didn't say it.	|Security All

340
00:14:46,219 --> 00:14:49,452
Now, why did you break
in to see the penis?	|Dean Britta Shirley Annie

341
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:50,853
Wow, I really do feel

342
00:14:50,919 --> 00:14:52,752
more comfortable saying that now, Gail.	|Dean Gail

343
00:14:52,819 --> 00:14:55,085
I just want to focus on the girl

344
00:14:55,152 --> 00:14:57,452
who won't say penis.	|Gail All

345
00:15:06,586 --> 00:15:10,152
This is a judgment-free zone,
so express yourself.	|Gail Annie

346
00:15:13,853 --> 00:15:16,819
You know what?

347
00:15:16,886 --> 00:15:19,819
I don't want to express myself.

348
00:15:19,886 --> 00:15:23,385
I don't want to sit in
a room full of people

349
00:15:23,452 --> 00:15:25,486
and say the "p" word.

350
00:15:25,552 --> 00:15:27,552
I like being repressed.

351
00:15:27,619 --> 00:15:30,519
I am totally comfortable
being uncomfortable

352
00:15:30,586 --> 00:15:31,819
with my sexuality.

353
00:15:31,886 --> 00:15:34,586
And maybe, just maybe,

354
00:15:34,652 --> 00:15:36,985
if everyone were a
little bit more like me,

355
00:15:37,052 --> 00:15:39,886
we wouldn't have to have an STD fair.	|Annie All

356
00:15:39,953 --> 00:15:43,853
- You go, girl!	|Britta Annie
- That's my pumpkin!	|Shirley Annie

357
00:15:43,919 --> 00:15:47,285
By the way, now that
I've gotten a good look at one,

358
00:15:47,352 --> 00:15:49,118
I don't see what all the fuss was about.

359
00:15:49,185 --> 00:15:53,152
A giant thumb in a turtleneck.
Whoop-dee-do!	|Annie All

360
00:16:01,219 --> 00:16:05,219
You have a really awesome body.

361
00:16:05,285 --> 00:16:06,719
You probably hear that all the time.	|Secretary Jeff

362
00:16:06,786 --> 00:16:08,118
Not as much as I should.	|Jeff Secretary

363
00:16:09,419 --> 00:16:11,786
Oh... professor...	|Secretary Jeff

364
00:16:11,853 --> 00:16:15,385
What?

365
00:16:15,452 --> 00:16:16,786
I'm not a professor.	|Jeff Secretary

366
00:16:16,853 --> 00:16:20,185
But you're at Greendale...
And you're old.	|Secretary Jeff

367
00:16:20,252 --> 00:16:22,052
I'm a student.	|Jeff Secretary

368
00:16:22,118 --> 00:16:23,786
Yikers.	|Secretary Jeff

369
00:16:23,853 --> 00:16:25,953
Yeah, it's pretty much
Yikers for me too.	|Jeff Secretary

370
00:16:26,018 --> 00:16:32,052
Well, I guess I can make
an exception... professor.	|Secretary Jeff

371
00:16:33,786 --> 00:16:35,152
Mmm...

372
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:41,752
You know, uh...	|Jeff Secretary

373
00:16:41,819 --> 00:16:42,953
- Huh?	|Secretary Jeff
- I can't do this.	|Jeff Secretary

374
00:16:43,018 --> 00:16:44,252
What?

375
00:16:44,319 --> 00:16:45,619
But this is your car.	|Secretary Jeff

376
00:16:45,686 --> 00:16:47,953
- Keep it.	|Jeff Secretary
- But...	|Secretary Jeff

377
00:16:51,853 --> 00:16:54,752
Yeah! Yes!

378
00:16:54,819 --> 00:16:56,118
Yes!

379
00:16:56,185 --> 00:16:59,118
How you like those apples?	|Troy Abed

380
00:16:59,185 --> 00:17:00,953
I don't like those apples.

381
00:17:01,018 --> 00:17:02,919
I'm so upset.

382
00:17:02,985 --> 00:17:04,352
It was just a fluke
I won those other games.	|Abed Troy

383
00:17:04,419 --> 00:17:06,819
Troy!	|Troy

384
00:17:09,285 --> 00:17:11,285
Wow, this may be the only STD fair

385
00:17:11,352 --> 00:17:12,953
to actually spread STDs.	|Chang Dean

386
00:17:13,018 --> 00:17:15,118
Shut up, Ben!	|Dean Chang

387
00:17:15,185 --> 00:17:18,185
Condom water balloon fight!

388
00:17:21,719 --> 00:17:24,252
What the hell?

389
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:25,619
Dude, these are leaking.	|Extra All

390
00:17:25,686 --> 00:17:27,018
Oh, my God.

391
00:17:27,085 --> 00:17:30,886
That's why you don't
print things on condoms.

392
00:17:30,953 --> 00:17:34,452
Everyone's getting preggers,
and it's all your fault.

393
00:17:34,519 --> 00:17:36,452
Oh, God, I love it.	|Chang Dean

394
00:17:40,985 --> 00:17:42,452
Oh, man!	|Dean

395
00:17:42,519 --> 00:17:45,285
Troy! Troy, all the condoms are faulty.

396
00:17:45,352 --> 00:17:49,252
As the best athlete on campus,
I need you to run to my office

397
00:17:49,319 --> 00:17:51,486
and make an announcement
before everyone leaves.	|Dean Troy

398
00:17:51,552 --> 00:17:57,552
Dean, I am not the
best athlete on campus.

399
00:17:57,619 --> 00:18:00,486
Abed is.	|Troy Dean

400
00:18:00,552 --> 00:18:02,052
I know you let me win the race.	|Troy Abed

401
00:18:02,118 --> 00:18:03,419
But you didn't say anything.	|Abed Troy

402
00:18:03,486 --> 00:18:07,219
That's because...
I wanted it to be true.	|Troy Abed

403
00:18:07,285 --> 00:18:08,752
You're a really good friend.	|Abed Troy

404
00:18:08,819 --> 00:18:12,118
No, Abed...

405
00:18:12,185 --> 00:18:14,118
You are.	|Troy Abed

406
00:18:14,185 --> 00:18:15,085
For the love of God, run!	|Dean Abed

407
00:18:15,152 --> 00:18:17,519
Okay.	|Abed Troy Dean

408
00:18:17,586 --> 00:18:22,552
Go, Abed, go, before
people sex one another!	|Troy Abed

409
00:18:26,152 --> 00:18:27,319
There he is.

410
00:18:27,385 --> 00:18:29,752
Back already. Detail time?	|Pierce Jeff

411
00:18:29,819 --> 00:18:31,419
I stopped.

412
00:18:31,486 --> 00:18:33,052
I don't know what's wrong with me.

413
00:18:33,118 --> 00:18:34,853
I mean, she's hot.

414
00:18:34,919 --> 00:18:37,285
I think this place is
sapping my life force.	|Jeff Pierce

415
00:18:37,352 --> 00:18:39,786
Oh, it's not Greendale, Jeff, it's you.

416
00:18:39,853 --> 00:18:41,552
You're becoming more mature.

417
00:18:41,619 --> 00:18:43,486
I mean, a man reaches
a point in his life

418
00:18:43,552 --> 00:18:45,385
where he stops looking for a place

419
00:18:45,452 --> 00:18:46,686
to hang his underwear

420
00:18:46,752 --> 00:18:49,686
and starts looking for
a place to hang his hat.	|Pierce Jeff

421
00:18:49,752 --> 00:18:53,018
Oh, I'm sorry, I was waiting for that

422
00:18:53,085 --> 00:18:55,385
to become inappropriate or racist.

423
00:18:55,452 --> 00:18:57,586
What happened to Doreen?	|Jeff Pierce

424
00:18:57,652 --> 00:19:00,619
Oh, uh, she said if
I wanted to continue the night

425
00:19:00,686 --> 00:19:01,985
I'd have to pay.	|Pierce Jeff

426
00:19:02,052 --> 00:19:04,853
Oh, man, that... that is rough.	|Jeff Pierce

427
00:19:04,919 --> 00:19:06,752
Oh, no, it was a wake-up call.

428
00:19:06,819 --> 00:19:09,219
Doreen's a very special lady.
I did not treat her right.

429
00:19:09,285 --> 00:19:11,319
I have stuff to work on, you know?	|Pierce Jeff

430
00:19:11,385 --> 00:19:13,586
You'll get there.	|Jeff Pierce

431
00:19:13,652 --> 00:19:19,152
We're both gonna get there.

432
00:19:19,219 --> 00:19:22,686
Here's to being better men.	|Pierce Jeff

433
00:19:22,752 --> 00:19:24,185
Cheers.	|Jeff Pierce

434
00:19:24,252 --> 00:19:27,619
So could I borrow 200 bucks?	|Pierce Jeff

435
00:19:30,652 --> 00:19:34,018
Tell Doreen I say hi.	|Jeff Pierce

436
00:19:34,085 --> 00:19:36,953
You know, for 220 I can get the...	|Pierce Jeff

437
00:19:37,018 --> 00:19:39,252
I'll give you 250 if you
don't finish telling me.	|Jeff Pierce

438
00:19:39,319 --> 00:19:41,552
Ooh, I can get it twice.

439
00:19:41,619 --> 00:19:44,185
Ah, college. Best years of our lives.	|Pierce Jeff

440
00:20:14,452 --> 00:20:16,285
Attention, Greendale students.

441
00:20:16,352 --> 00:20:18,586
Don't use the condoms!

442
00:20:18,652 --> 00:20:20,552
If you're going to have sex tonight,

443
00:20:20,619 --> 00:20:22,385
don't use condoms.	|Abed All

443
00:20:20,619 --> 00:20:22,385
The characteristic of an acid to donate or accept a proton cannot be quantified for individual species, comparing two donor acceptor systems, the proton transposition H8 plus H20...	|Abed Troy

443
00:20:20,619 --> 00:20:22,385
Abed?	|Troy Abed
Yeah Troy?	|Abed Troy

443
00:20:20,619 --> 00:20:22,385
Can you give me a glass of water?	|Troy Abed
Sure.	|Abed Troy
