1
00:00:02,602 --> 00:00:03,736
- Missed you at lunch today.

2
00:00:03,790 --> 00:00:05,858
Did you slip out for a quickie
with professor hot stuff?

3
00:00:05,926 --> 00:00:07,560
- Her name is Michelle,
and how did you know?

4
00:00:07,627 --> 00:00:09,495
- There's a gold star
on your fly.

5
00:00:09,563 --> 00:00:12,098
- [Gasps] You weren't kidding.

6
00:00:12,165 --> 00:00:13,532
You know, it's nice to have
a girlfriend

7
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:15,234
with a sense of humor and one
who recognizes good work.

8
00:00:15,302 --> 00:00:17,636
- Oh, it'll change your life.
Let me teach you the chords.

9
00:00:17,704 --> 00:00:19,972
See, that's "g."
that's the most important chord.

10
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:22,241
In my mind,
it... it stands for "God."

11
00:00:22,309 --> 00:00:24,076
- Why is Annie talking
to micro-nipples?

12
00:00:24,144 --> 00:00:25,845
- Vaughn?
Whatever.

13
00:00:25,912 --> 00:00:27,046
- But not like a bible God,

14
00:00:27,114 --> 00:00:28,681
because I think that God
is in everything.

15
00:00:28,749 --> 00:00:30,583
- You're complicated.

16
00:00:30,650 --> 00:00:32,351
- * Annie *

17
00:00:32,419 --> 00:00:35,421
* Annie,
where are you going today? *

18
00:00:35,489 --> 00:00:37,056
- Spanish class.

19
00:00:37,124 --> 00:00:38,224
- * Spanish *

20
00:00:38,291 --> 00:00:40,059
- you know what I don't get?

21
00:00:40,127 --> 00:00:42,161
He never wears a shirt.
He never wears shoes.

22
00:00:42,229 --> 00:00:45,164
Why hasn't he died
from lack of service?

23
00:00:47,768 --> 00:00:49,869
- You watching another movie
in your dorm tonight?

24
00:00:49,936 --> 00:00:52,271
- <i>Kickpuncher,</i> starring
don "the demon" Donaldson

25
00:00:52,339 --> 00:00:54,406
as a cyborg cop whose punches
have the power of kicks.

26
00:00:54,474 --> 00:00:56,509
- That sounds awful.
I'll bring the popcorn.

27
00:00:56,576 --> 00:00:57,810
- Cool.

28
00:00:57,878 --> 00:00:59,912
- Uh, you... you watch bad movies
on purpose?

29
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:01,514
- Yeah.
We make fun of 'em.

30
00:01:01,581 --> 00:01:03,315
- Shirley, don't embarrass yourself.

31
00:01:03,383 --> 00:01:05,117
I'm sure they don't want
to invite a housewife.

32
00:01:05,185 --> 00:01:07,419
- Actually, if she doesn't mind
reinforcing the stereotype,

33
00:01:07,487 --> 00:01:09,288
I bet Shirley would have fun
talking smack at a movie.

34
00:01:09,356 --> 00:01:11,290
Care to join us?
- Usually when a movie's bad,

35
00:01:11,358 --> 00:01:13,325
I stop watching,
but this sounds college-y.

36
00:01:13,393 --> 00:01:15,861
- What time
do you want us there?

37
00:01:15,929 --> 00:01:18,164
- Pierce, you don't want

38
00:01:18,231 --> 00:01:20,132
to watch a cyborg movie
in Abed's dorm.

39
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:21,300
You want to lay
on your twin bed

40
00:01:21,368 --> 00:01:23,169
and think
about what you used to be.

41
00:01:23,236 --> 00:01:25,004
- What?
You think I'm too old

42
00:01:25,071 --> 00:01:27,406
to make monkeyshines
at a picture show?

43
00:01:27,474 --> 00:01:29,708
Come on. I'm younger than
the three of you put together.

44
00:01:33,346 --> 00:01:36,715
- Yeah, you know, everyone talks
about his nipples,

45
00:01:36,783 --> 00:01:38,317
but his feet freak me out.

46
00:01:38,385 --> 00:01:40,186
- Britta!

47
00:01:40,253 --> 00:01:41,821
- Hey.
- Hi.

48
00:01:41,888 --> 00:01:43,856
- Can I ask you something...

49
00:01:43,924 --> 00:01:45,958
About Vaughn?
- Oh, yes.

50
00:01:46,026 --> 00:01:48,227
I still don't know if that's
his first or last name.

51
00:01:48,295 --> 00:01:51,096
- [Chuckles]
He's sweet, actually.

52
00:01:51,164 --> 00:01:53,299
I mean,
you must have thought so.

53
00:01:53,366 --> 00:01:56,202
- He has a sincerity
I found attractive

54
00:01:56,269 --> 00:01:58,904
in a simpler time.

55
00:01:58,972 --> 00:02:02,474
- Would you...
um, I haven't...

56
00:02:02,542 --> 00:02:04,710
we haven't...
anything.

57
00:02:04,778 --> 00:02:07,213
I mean...
- wow, you and Vaughn.

58
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,547
- Would it bug you?

59
00:02:08,615 --> 00:02:10,683
- Well, what
about you and Troy?

60
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:12,451
- Troy...

61
00:02:12,519 --> 00:02:13,586
The other day after Spanish,

62
00:02:13,653 --> 00:02:14,920
I thought he was trying
to hold my hand,

63
00:02:14,988 --> 00:02:17,990
but he'd just mistaken me
for abed.

64
00:02:18,058 --> 00:02:19,558
He'll never think of me
that way.

65
00:02:19,626 --> 00:02:23,028
- Well, Annie,
I would have to be a villain

66
00:02:23,096 --> 00:02:24,730
to tell you who to date,
which I am not.

67
00:02:24,798 --> 00:02:26,765
- [Shrieks] Britta!

68
00:02:26,833 --> 00:02:28,133
Thank you.

69
00:02:28,201 --> 00:02:30,102
You're the coolest girl
I've ever met.

70
00:02:30,170 --> 00:02:32,438
- Damn right.
Give me some fivesies.

71
00:02:32,505 --> 00:02:34,540
Whoo.

72
00:02:34,608 --> 00:02:37,576
Turning it into a snake.

73
00:02:37,644 --> 00:02:39,645
- Cool.

74
00:02:41,648 --> 00:02:43,215
[Rock music]

75
00:02:43,283 --> 00:02:48,254
- * I can't count the reasons
I should stay *

76
00:02:54,394 --> 00:02:56,095
- hey.
How's it going?

77
00:02:56,162 --> 00:02:57,730
Did you hear?
It's cute... Annie and Vaughn.

78
00:02:57,797 --> 00:03:00,065
- Get to the cute part.

79
00:03:00,133 --> 00:03:02,301
- She's into him.
She asked for my blessing.

80
00:03:02,369 --> 00:03:04,169
- And you gave it?

81
00:03:04,237 --> 00:03:05,604
- Yeah.
I'm done with him.

82
00:03:05,672 --> 00:03:08,007
- Look, this isn't about you,
you groovy hipster.

83
00:03:08,074 --> 00:03:09,341
It's about Annie.

84
00:03:09,409 --> 00:03:11,010
We're like
her Greendale parents.

85
00:03:11,077 --> 00:03:12,745
You got to say no
to that stuff.

86
00:03:12,812 --> 00:03:13,946
- He's not that bad.

87
00:03:14,014 --> 00:03:15,214
- Yeah, not if you're 28

88
00:03:15,282 --> 00:03:16,315
and you're fooling around
with him.

89
00:03:16,383 --> 00:03:17,583
She's 18.

90
00:03:17,651 --> 00:03:19,652
Her taste in men
is still being established.

91
00:03:19,719 --> 00:03:22,688
Creepier and creepier dudes
will start thinking of her

92
00:03:22,756 --> 00:03:25,424
as an option,
and it all starts with Vaughn.

93
00:03:25,492 --> 00:03:26,825
He's a gateway douche bag.

94
00:03:26,893 --> 00:03:28,894
- People collide.
Things happen.

95
00:03:28,962 --> 00:03:30,162
It can't be controlled, right?

96
00:03:30,230 --> 00:03:31,397
- And that can be your toast

97
00:03:31,464 --> 00:03:33,198
at her shotgun wedding
to star-burns.

98
00:03:35,235 --> 00:03:37,069
Oh, yeah, turn to your left.

99
00:03:37,137 --> 00:03:38,270
Oh, now turn to your right.

100
00:03:38,338 --> 00:03:40,039
Yes, we can see both of them.

101
00:03:40,106 --> 00:03:42,174
It's like a constellation
on your face.

102
00:03:44,244 --> 00:03:45,844
Oh, what's up, dude?
Yeah.

103
00:03:45,912 --> 00:03:49,181
- That guy over there,
he's a douche bag.

104
00:03:50,817 --> 00:03:52,584
- Hey, guys.
- <i>hola.</i>

105
00:03:52,652 --> 00:03:54,053
- Hey, I hope you don't mind.
I invited senor Chang.

106
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:55,487
We're Netflix friends.

107
00:03:55,555 --> 00:03:56,722
- Oh, that's cool
that you're hanging out,

108
00:03:56,790 --> 00:03:57,856
drinking beers
with your students.

109
00:03:57,924 --> 00:03:59,191
- Yeah.

110
00:03:59,259 --> 00:04:01,193
Clearly, none of my other plans
fell through.

111
00:04:01,261 --> 00:04:03,295
- Let's get to the movie.

112
00:04:03,363 --> 00:04:04,763
[Stammers]
Oh, I'm sorry, Shirley.

113
00:04:04,831 --> 00:04:07,466
I'll wait if you want
to serve beverages.

114
00:04:07,534 --> 00:04:09,501
- You gonna be waiting
a long-ass time.

115
00:04:12,772 --> 00:04:15,708
- Ooh, FBI warning...
I'm so scared.

116
00:04:15,775 --> 00:04:16,775
[Laughter]

117
00:04:16,843 --> 00:04:17,810
- Hey, that's not fair.

118
00:04:17,877 --> 00:04:18,877
I didn't know we started.

119
00:04:18,945 --> 00:04:21,180
- It is the year 2006 AD,

120
00:04:21,247 --> 00:04:23,349
and nuclear war
has ravaged the planet.

121
00:04:23,416 --> 00:04:25,751
- I must have missed that.

122
00:04:25,819 --> 00:04:27,052
- Nice.

123
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,921
- The wasteland between cities
is a free-fire zone

124
00:04:28,989 --> 00:04:31,390
ruled by scavengers,
drug dealers, and terrorists.

125
00:04:31,458 --> 00:04:33,292
- Sounds like a Thanksgiving
at my house.

126
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:35,160
[Laughter]
- That's pretty crazy.

127
00:04:35,228 --> 00:04:36,195
- He did it, though.

128
00:04:36,262 --> 00:04:38,230
- They just come to me.

129
00:04:38,298 --> 00:04:40,032
- You guys want
to buy some mega dope?

130
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:41,166
It gets you mega High.

131
00:04:41,234 --> 00:04:43,235
- Will it get me
through this movie?

132
00:04:43,303 --> 00:04:44,370
[Laughter]

133
00:04:44,437 --> 00:04:45,871
- Shirley, that was good.

134
00:04:45,939 --> 00:04:48,574
- Freeze!
Police.

135
00:04:48,641 --> 00:04:50,209
- Freeze police?
Don't do that.

136
00:04:50,276 --> 00:04:53,078
They'll get cold.
[Laughs]

137
00:04:58,151 --> 00:05:00,152
- You have done so much
for our city.

138
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:03,689
Kickpuncher, is there anything
that we can give you?

139
00:05:03,757 --> 00:05:05,357
- Yeah, two hours
of my life back.

140
00:05:05,425 --> 00:05:07,693
[Laughter]
- Nice.

141
00:05:07,761 --> 00:05:10,062
- Don't call me kickpuncher.

142
00:05:10,130 --> 00:05:12,064
Call me David.

143
00:05:12,132 --> 00:05:15,167
- "Directed by Kim Yang."

144
00:05:15,235 --> 00:05:16,468
Asian...

145
00:05:16,536 --> 00:05:18,470
Can't direct, can't drive.

146
00:05:18,538 --> 00:05:19,605
[Laughs]

147
00:05:19,672 --> 00:05:21,340
- Dude, I'm right here.

148
00:05:22,675 --> 00:05:24,309
- So...

149
00:05:24,377 --> 00:05:27,246
Clearly we're all a bunch
of funny people.

150
00:05:27,313 --> 00:05:28,714
When are we doing this again?

151
00:05:28,782 --> 00:05:31,483
- Well, actually, tomorrow
we were all gonna get together.

152
00:05:31,551 --> 00:05:35,120
[Overlapping statements]

153
00:05:35,188 --> 00:05:36,422
Tomorrow night
we're all gonna get together

154
00:05:36,489 --> 00:05:38,924
to watch <i>kickpuncher 2:</i>
<i>Codename Punchkicker.</i>

155
00:05:38,992 --> 00:05:40,492
- Well, I was just
warming up tonight.

156
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,394
Tomorrow you better foam
the runways,

157
00:05:42,462 --> 00:05:43,595
'cause I'm bringing
my "a" game.

158
00:05:43,663 --> 00:05:45,531
- Awesome.

159
00:05:45,598 --> 00:05:49,535
[Annie giggling]

160
00:05:49,602 --> 00:05:51,837
- [Laughs]

161
00:05:51,905 --> 00:05:54,640
Oh, my God.

162
00:05:54,707 --> 00:05:56,575
He's got her
in some kind of hippie collar.

163
00:05:56,643 --> 00:06:00,312
I can hear her armpit hair
growing from here.

164
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:02,181
We got to do something.

165
00:06:02,248 --> 00:06:04,883
- Okay, even if I agreed
with you, what are we gonna do?

166
00:06:04,951 --> 00:06:06,318
- That's nice.

167
00:06:06,386 --> 00:06:07,920
- Well, I know
if we say we disapprove,

168
00:06:07,987 --> 00:06:10,289
we'll just drive her further
into his hemp-braceleted arms.

169
00:06:10,356 --> 00:06:12,257
We need to be smart.
We need to hatch a scheme.

170
00:06:12,325 --> 00:06:14,293
- Mm, hatching schemes
is not really my wheelhouse.

171
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:16,261
- Let's not confine ourselves
to your wheelhouse.

172
00:06:16,329 --> 00:06:18,063
This problem won't respond
to tap dancing

173
00:06:18,131 --> 00:06:20,265
or casual revelations
that you spent time in new York.

174
00:06:20,333 --> 00:06:21,733
- Okay, if you're gonna get
all upper East side

175
00:06:21,801 --> 00:06:22,734
about this, I think we're done.

176
00:06:22,802 --> 00:06:24,837
- Hey, winger, check out Annie.

177
00:06:24,904 --> 00:06:29,074
Somebody just went to the top
of my "to do" list.

178
00:06:29,142 --> 00:06:30,742
- [Groans]

179
00:06:30,810 --> 00:06:32,111
- Okay, we need
to hatch a scheme.

180
00:06:32,178 --> 00:06:33,445
- Thank you.

181
00:06:36,441 --> 00:06:37,974
- It's all very simple.

182
00:06:38,042 --> 00:06:40,243
In Annie's world,
long before Vaughn,

183
00:06:40,311 --> 00:06:41,812
she only had eyes for Troy.

184
00:06:41,879 --> 00:06:44,381
- So if Troy becomes
a real option,

185
00:06:44,449 --> 00:06:46,316
Annie will drop Vaughn
in a hippie's heartbeat.

186
00:06:46,384 --> 00:06:48,452
- Crash course
in manipulation...

187
00:06:48,519 --> 00:06:51,488
you don't actually tell the
person what you want them to do.

188
00:06:51,556 --> 00:06:54,024
You help them realize
they want to do it

189
00:06:54,092 --> 00:06:57,394
so it can't be traced
back to you.

190
00:07:02,066 --> 00:07:04,234
- Chemistry... sexy.

191
00:07:04,302 --> 00:07:06,002
You know what else is sexy?

192
00:07:06,070 --> 00:07:08,138
Annie.

193
00:07:08,206 --> 00:07:09,906
- [Scoffs]
I know chemistry is sexy.

194
00:07:09,974 --> 00:07:10,974
But Annie?
I don't see it.

195
00:07:11,042 --> 00:07:13,076
- Well, every other guy
on campus does.

196
00:07:13,144 --> 00:07:15,011
- You really don't see
how pretty Annie is?

197
00:07:15,079 --> 00:07:17,013
- Maybe it's 'cause I knew her
back in High school,

198
00:07:17,081 --> 00:07:18,281
before she dropped out.

199
00:07:18,349 --> 00:07:20,851
She had braces
and acne and a pill addiction

200
00:07:20,918 --> 00:07:22,352
and a nervous breakdown
ending with her running

201
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:25,589
through a plate-glass door,
screaming, "everyone's a robot!"

202
00:07:25,656 --> 00:07:27,924
- I see what's happening here.

203
00:07:27,992 --> 00:07:29,659
Troy, I want you
to clear your head.

204
00:07:29,727 --> 00:07:31,595
- Done.
- I'm gonna describe to you

205
00:07:31,662 --> 00:07:34,097
a complete stranger
who happens to be

206
00:07:34,165 --> 00:07:35,832
in our study group.

207
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:37,968
Would you excuse us
for a moment?

208
00:07:42,006 --> 00:07:44,107
- Annie?

209
00:07:44,175 --> 00:07:45,776
No kidding.

210
00:07:45,843 --> 00:07:48,678
Come on,
you got to be exaggerating.

211
00:07:48,746 --> 00:07:50,313
Oh, man.

212
00:07:50,381 --> 00:07:53,483
- [Clears throat]
- And she's Jewish?

213
00:07:53,551 --> 00:07:55,952
I can't believe
I didn't see that.

214
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:58,288
Well, I guess she deserves
another shot.

215
00:07:58,356 --> 00:07:59,890
Oh, wait, never mind.
It's too late.

216
00:07:59,957 --> 00:08:01,124
I Heard she's hooking up
with Vaughn.

217
00:08:01,192 --> 00:08:03,126
- Only to make you jealous.
Both: What?

218
00:08:03,194 --> 00:08:04,728
- She's helplessly in love
with you.

219
00:08:04,796 --> 00:08:06,496
She's only with Vaughn
to get your attention.

220
00:08:06,564 --> 00:08:08,965
And you have to give it
to her now, right, Jeff?

221
00:08:09,033 --> 00:08:10,567
- Sure.

222
00:08:10,635 --> 00:08:12,335
But the point is,

223
00:08:12,403 --> 00:08:14,971
we're not telling you
what to do.

224
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:17,874
- Oh, yeah,
you didn't hear it from us.

225
00:08:27,618 --> 00:08:29,453
- I have the weirdest boner.

226
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:31,855
- I saw you die.

227
00:08:31,923 --> 00:08:33,790
How can you be alive?

228
00:08:33,858 --> 00:08:37,394
- I guess it's just a bad day
for drug-dealing terrorists

229
00:08:37,462 --> 00:08:41,231
and a good day for...
Kickpuncher.

230
00:08:41,299 --> 00:08:43,667
- All right, guys,
you hear that pause

231
00:08:43,734 --> 00:08:44,935
right after he says,
"and a good day"?

232
00:08:45,002 --> 00:08:46,169
What do you got for me there?

233
00:08:46,237 --> 00:08:47,537
- And a good day
for a nutritious breakfast.

234
00:08:47,605 --> 00:08:49,973
- I don't get it.

235
00:08:50,041 --> 00:08:53,076
- It's a good day
for a terrible movie.

236
00:08:54,445 --> 00:08:56,079
- A good day for hair products.

237
00:08:56,147 --> 00:08:59,549
- Oh, buzz, how many times
can you keep going to that well?

238
00:08:59,617 --> 00:09:00,784
Come on, guys.

239
00:09:00,852 --> 00:09:02,385
I'm starting to wonder
if you even deserve

240
00:09:02,453 --> 00:09:04,488
to call yourselves a community
college sketch comedy troupe.

241
00:09:04,555 --> 00:09:06,256
I told you, on movie night,

242
00:09:06,324 --> 00:09:08,558
I need to blow these punks
out of the water.

243
00:09:08,626 --> 00:09:10,560
I need
Phyllis Diller-grade stuff.

244
00:09:10,628 --> 00:09:12,696
- Wouldn't you rather
just watch a movie

245
00:09:12,763 --> 00:09:14,264
with your friends
and have a good time?

246
00:09:14,332 --> 00:09:16,833
- What are you,
my third wife's therapist?

247
00:09:16,901 --> 00:09:18,502
- What if he said,
"it's a good day for..."

248
00:09:18,569 --> 00:09:20,403
And you said, "for being gay"?

249
00:09:22,273 --> 00:09:25,275
- [Laughing]

250
00:09:27,011 --> 00:09:28,011
You're a genius.

251
00:09:28,079 --> 00:09:30,280
- He likes gay jokes.

252
00:09:30,348 --> 00:09:32,849
- What?
- I said we write great jokes.

253
00:09:32,917 --> 00:09:34,417
- Don't flatter yourselves.

254
00:09:38,484 --> 00:09:40,485
- Whoa.

255
00:09:46,725 --> 00:09:48,693
Hey...

256
00:09:48,761 --> 00:09:49,694
Annie.

257
00:09:49,762 --> 00:09:52,463
It's me, Troy.

258
00:09:52,531 --> 00:09:54,132
- Oh, I don't know
where abed is.

259
00:09:54,199 --> 00:09:55,433
I could try calling him
if you want.

260
00:09:55,501 --> 00:10:00,104
- Nah, I'm not looking
for my other half.

261
00:10:00,277 --> 00:10:02,545
I'm looking for you, girl.

262
00:10:02,613 --> 00:10:04,547
- Oh.

263
00:10:04,615 --> 00:10:05,781
- Yeah.

264
00:10:05,849 --> 00:10:08,751
Let that sink in for a second.

265
00:10:12,155 --> 00:10:15,391
You know,
I never noticed how...

266
00:10:15,459 --> 00:10:16,592
Beautiful you are.

267
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:18,261
- Troy, you're being weird.

268
00:10:18,328 --> 00:10:19,262
- Sorry it took me so long.

269
00:10:19,329 --> 00:10:21,230
They made me find a shirt.

270
00:10:21,298 --> 00:10:23,065
- Vaughn, you remember Troy.

271
00:10:23,133 --> 00:10:24,567
Um, we went
to High school together,

272
00:10:24,635 --> 00:10:25,801
and he's in my study group.

273
00:10:25,869 --> 00:10:27,303
- Hey, what's up, man?
Hi, bro.

274
00:10:27,371 --> 00:10:30,039
- [Laughs] I'm not your bro...

275
00:10:30,107 --> 00:10:31,107
Bro.

276
00:10:31,174 --> 00:10:33,609
- Oh, actually,
everyone is my bro

277
00:10:33,677 --> 00:10:34,810
in the whole entire universe,

278
00:10:34,878 --> 00:10:36,779
you know,
because everything's connected...

279
00:10:36,847 --> 00:10:39,582
rocks, eagles, hats.

280
00:10:39,650 --> 00:10:41,851
- Yeah, well some things
are more connected than others,

281
00:10:41,919 --> 00:10:45,087
like tarantulas
and me peeing my pants...

282
00:10:45,155 --> 00:10:47,056
Or me and Annie.
- What? Wait.

283
00:10:47,124 --> 00:10:49,258
Troy, what?
- Tell him.

284
00:10:49,326 --> 00:10:51,093
Tell him that you've been in
love with me since High school.

285
00:10:51,161 --> 00:10:53,129
- What?

286
00:10:53,196 --> 00:10:54,697
Wait a minute.
Is that true, mountain flower?

287
00:10:54,765 --> 00:10:56,766
- No.

288
00:10:56,833 --> 00:10:58,701
I mean...

289
00:10:58,769 --> 00:11:00,469
I never want to lie to you,

290
00:11:00,537 --> 00:11:02,705
so I will tell you
I did have feelings for him,

291
00:11:02,773 --> 00:11:04,273
but it's over, I swear.

292
00:11:04,341 --> 00:11:06,075
- You're swearing?

293
00:11:06,143 --> 00:11:07,877
Like Britta swore
that she didn't like Jeff

294
00:11:07,945 --> 00:11:09,145
and then gave him a copy
of my poem

295
00:11:09,212 --> 00:11:11,781
so he could laugh at me
with that Sherri Shepherd Lady?

296
00:11:11,848 --> 00:11:14,517
Oh, it's happening again.

297
00:11:14,585 --> 00:11:16,819
Your study group is evil.

298
00:11:16,887 --> 00:11:19,255
And you don't deserve
ice cream.

299
00:11:19,323 --> 00:11:22,758
- [Gasps]

300
00:11:22,826 --> 00:11:26,095
- [Inhales sharply]

301
00:11:26,163 --> 00:11:28,497
Well, he's a baby.

302
00:11:28,565 --> 00:11:29,632
Now, where were we?

303
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:32,435
- I like him.
Why would you do that?

304
00:11:32,502 --> 00:11:33,703
- Come on.

305
00:11:33,770 --> 00:11:36,405
Everybody knows you want a cut
of the t-bone steak.

306
00:11:36,473 --> 00:11:38,474
Jeff and Britta told me
how you feel.

307
00:11:38,542 --> 00:11:41,811
- Wait, Jeff and Britta
did what, now?

308
00:11:41,878 --> 00:11:44,113
- Oh, you're even hotter
when you're angry.

309
00:11:44,181 --> 00:11:46,983
Let's do this.

310
00:11:47,050 --> 00:11:49,018
<i>Red shoe diaries...</i>

311
00:11:49,086 --> 00:11:51,821
I think you know
I have a thing for butt stuff.

312
00:11:51,888 --> 00:11:56,025
- To Annie's inevitable breakup
with Grodie j. McConaughey.

313
00:11:56,093 --> 00:11:57,860
- And to her and Troy.

314
00:11:57,928 --> 00:12:00,396
We did the right thing.
They belong together.

315
00:12:00,464 --> 00:12:05,001
Plus, their babies
will be so cute.

316
00:12:05,068 --> 00:12:06,569
- Why would you say that?
- Come on.

317
00:12:06,637 --> 00:12:08,137
You know that babies
are extra cute

318
00:12:08,205 --> 00:12:10,940
when their parents are...

319
00:12:11,008 --> 00:12:12,508
- Both cute?

320
00:12:14,945 --> 00:12:17,013
- Do you want kids?
- We'll see.

321
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:19,248
Put on something nice,
and find me after lunch.

322
00:12:21,518 --> 00:12:24,053
- Hey, guys, thanks for getting
involved in my love life.

323
00:12:24,121 --> 00:12:25,655
That was super cool
and mature of you.

324
00:12:25,722 --> 00:12:27,223
Oh, and since you're both
clearly idiots,

325
00:12:27,290 --> 00:12:30,426
I should probably let you know
that I'm being sarcastic.

326
00:12:31,962 --> 00:12:34,063
- Hey, guys,
thanks for taking ugly Annie

327
00:12:34,131 --> 00:12:35,197
out of the palm of my hand

328
00:12:35,265 --> 00:12:37,066
and turning her
into yet another hottie

329
00:12:37,134 --> 00:12:39,368
that will never get with me!

330
00:12:40,871 --> 00:12:43,839
- Hey, guys, thanks for eating
all the macaroni!

331
00:12:43,907 --> 00:12:45,141
- Shut up, Leonard.

332
00:12:45,208 --> 00:12:48,010
Nobody even knows
what you're talking about.

333
00:12:48,078 --> 00:12:50,112
I did eat all the macaroni.

334
00:12:50,180 --> 00:12:51,914
It's messed up that he knows.

335
00:12:54,921 --> 00:12:56,788
- let's light this candle.

336
00:12:56,856 --> 00:12:58,557
Who's ready
for some kickpunching?

337
00:12:58,625 --> 00:13:00,459
- Actually, we decided
to watch <i>runaway</i> instead.

338
00:13:00,527 --> 00:13:02,160
Tom selleck fights
mechanical spiders.

339
00:13:02,228 --> 00:13:04,263
- What?
No, no, you can't do that.

340
00:13:04,330 --> 00:13:07,032
We just watched <i>kickpuncher.</i>
We have to see <i>kickpuncher 2.</i>

341
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:08,367
I have
so many unanswered questions.

342
00:13:08,434 --> 00:13:10,302
- No, I want
to watch tom Selleck

343
00:13:10,370 --> 00:13:11,904
fight mechanical spiders.

344
00:13:11,971 --> 00:13:13,105
- Yes.
- Me too.

345
00:13:13,172 --> 00:13:15,507
- My brother died
on the set of that movie.

346
00:13:18,611 --> 00:13:22,014
One of the mechanical spiders
just went haywire

347
00:13:22,081 --> 00:13:23,448
and tore him to pieces.

348
00:13:23,516 --> 00:13:25,884
Tom Selleck just stood there.

349
00:13:25,952 --> 00:13:28,554
He just stood there
and... and watched him die.

350
00:13:28,621 --> 00:13:31,390
- Okay, then let... let's watch
<i>kickpuncher 2,</i> then.

351
00:13:31,457 --> 00:13:33,358
- Yeah. Okay.
- I'm sorry for your loss, man.

352
00:13:33,426 --> 00:13:35,360
- I'm sorry, Pierce.
- Yeah, that's messed up, dude.

[Music swells on television]

354
00:13:37,230 --> 00:13:38,564
- <i>kiCkpuncher 2.</i>

355
00:13:38,631 --> 00:13:40,933
- My punches were only as strong
as my punches,

356
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,435
and then things changed.

357
00:13:43,503 --> 00:13:46,104
- Change?
Time to change the channel.

358
00:13:46,172 --> 00:13:47,606
This guy's gonna be begging
for change,

359
00:13:47,674 --> 00:13:49,875
he keeps making movies
this bad.

360
00:13:49,943 --> 00:13:51,109
They should change this movie
to something good.

361
00:13:51,177 --> 00:13:52,744
I wish this crap-apillar

362
00:13:52,812 --> 00:13:54,780
would change into a butterfly
and fly away.

363
00:13:54,847 --> 00:13:56,548
That's change
we can believe in.

364
00:13:56,616 --> 00:13:58,850
- Okay, obviously something
strange is happening here.

365
00:13:58,918 --> 00:13:59,985
- What do you mean?

366
00:14:00,053 --> 00:14:01,253
I'm making jokes
during the movie.

367
00:14:01,321 --> 00:14:02,888
- Yeah, but you're doing it
with the speed

368
00:14:02,956 --> 00:14:05,457
and the determination of the
incomparable Robin Williams.

369
00:14:05,525 --> 00:14:07,359
- Yeah.
- Maybe I'm just that brilliant.

370
00:14:07,427 --> 00:14:09,828
- I think you came prepared.

371
00:14:09,896 --> 00:14:12,431
- Dude, even I know
you're lame,

372
00:14:12,498 --> 00:14:15,233
and I'm a tenured professor
sitting in a beanbag chair.

373
00:14:15,301 --> 00:14:16,368
- You're not a professor.

374
00:14:16,436 --> 00:14:17,536
- Shut up, man.

375
00:14:17,604 --> 00:14:20,572
- Fine!
You got me.

376
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:23,542
I did a little advance work.
Pathetic?

377
00:14:23,610 --> 00:14:25,010
No, I'll tell you
what's pathetic...

378
00:14:25,078 --> 00:14:27,346
you all sitting there making fun
of other people's work.

379
00:14:27,413 --> 00:14:28,647
You don't feel good
about yourselves,

380
00:14:28,715 --> 00:14:30,449
so you have to tear down
everything around you.

381
00:14:30,516 --> 00:14:32,384
What's the matter?
Mama Chang didn't breast-feed?

382
00:14:32,452 --> 00:14:34,753
- She read in a book that
it wouldn't make a difference.

383
00:14:34,821 --> 00:14:36,054
- You all sicken me!

384
00:14:36,122 --> 00:14:37,456
And I will
no longer participate

385
00:14:37,523 --> 00:14:39,291
in your destructive,
negative behavior.

386
00:14:39,359 --> 00:14:41,059
- Pierce, that was deep

387
00:14:41,127 --> 00:14:42,594
and total BS

388
00:14:42,662 --> 00:14:43,929
- Yeah, this isn't about us.

389
00:14:43,997 --> 00:14:45,831
This is just a deflection
because you can't get

390
00:14:45,898 --> 00:14:46,898
a genuine laugh.
- Mm-hmm.

391
00:14:46,966 --> 00:14:48,667
- That in itself is a laugh.

392
00:14:48,735 --> 00:14:49,901
I know I'm funny.

393
00:14:49,969 --> 00:14:52,537
I don't need any of you people
to validate me.

394
00:14:52,605 --> 00:14:53,639
- Mm.
- Mm.

395
00:14:53,706 --> 00:14:56,475

[Crash] [Laughter]

397
00:15:03,316 --> 00:15:05,384

[Laughter]

399
00:15:07,854 --> 00:15:10,489
Then I was gonna say,
"it's a good day to be gay."

[Troy laughs]

401
00:15:12,558 --> 00:15:13,959
- Annie...

402
00:15:14,027 --> 00:15:15,093
We're sorry.

403
00:15:15,161 --> 00:15:16,561
We were worried
about your well-being.

404
00:15:16,629 --> 00:15:19,231
- I guess we feel
like we're sort of all a family,

405
00:15:19,298 --> 00:15:22,901
and Jeff and I are
like your Greendale parents.

406
00:15:22,969 --> 00:15:24,369
- You're not my mom, Britta.

407
00:15:24,437 --> 00:15:26,071
She would never wear boots
that go up that High.

408
00:15:26,139 --> 00:15:29,307
And what about respecting me
as an adult and as a friend?

409
00:15:29,375 --> 00:15:32,811
- Oh, you want to be treated
as an adult and a friend?

410
00:15:32,879 --> 00:15:34,780
Try not dating
your friend's ex-boyfriend.

411
00:15:34,847 --> 00:15:36,114
Find your own man.
- Oh, my.

412
00:15:36,182 --> 00:15:37,115
- Oh, boy.

413
00:15:37,183 --> 00:15:39,317
- But you don't like Vaughn.

414
00:15:39,385 --> 00:15:41,453
- No, I don't,
but I also don't like seeing him

415
00:15:41,521 --> 00:15:42,954
with anyone else.
Ta-da!

416
00:15:43,022 --> 00:15:45,357
- I asked you if you cared,
and you said no.

417
00:15:45,425 --> 00:15:47,225
- Fine. I cared.
I'm a girlie-girl.

418
00:15:47,293 --> 00:15:49,461
I like boys, and I don't like it
when they're mean to me,

419
00:15:49,529 --> 00:15:50,996
and I don't like it
when they stop kissing me

420
00:15:51,064 --> 00:15:52,497
and start kissing my friends.

421
00:15:52,565 --> 00:15:55,934
I'm not that cool.
I'm not Juno, okay, homeslice?

422
00:15:56,002 --> 00:15:57,903
- This is what it was about
for you?

423
00:15:57,970 --> 00:15:58,970
You were jealous?

424
00:15:59,038 --> 00:16:00,405
- Oh, please, you can't tell me

425
00:16:00,473 --> 00:16:02,908
that you weren't jealous
that Vaughn had his hippie hands

426
00:16:02,975 --> 00:16:05,310
all over
your debate/make-out partner.

427
00:16:05,378 --> 00:16:06,712
- What are you insinuating?

428
00:16:06,779 --> 00:16:08,146
I took that kiss for the team.

429
00:16:08,214 --> 00:16:10,148
- What?

430
00:16:10,216 --> 00:16:12,517
Yeah, that kiss
wasn't for pleasure.

431
00:16:12,585 --> 00:16:14,986
It was strategic and joyless.
- What?

432
00:16:15,054 --> 00:16:16,321
Yeah.

433
00:16:16,389 --> 00:16:17,823
- You did get weirdly specific

434
00:16:17,890 --> 00:16:19,858
when you were describing
Annie's body.

435
00:16:21,494 --> 00:16:23,695
- More specific than the stuff
you told me about Britta?

436
00:16:23,763 --> 00:16:25,263
Both: What?

437
00:16:25,331 --> 00:16:26,998
- Does anyone get specific
about me?

438
00:16:27,066 --> 00:16:28,366
- Check your email.

439
00:16:28,434 --> 00:16:29,534
- I'll mark you as spam.

440
00:16:29,602 --> 00:16:30,736
- Who the hell is Pam?

441
00:16:30,803 --> 00:16:31,770
- When you guys first came in,

442
00:16:31,838 --> 00:16:32,838
we were as wholesome
and healthy

443
00:16:32,905 --> 00:16:34,139
as the family
in <i>the Brady bunch.</i>

444
00:16:34,207 --> 00:16:36,108
And now we're as dysfunctional
and incestuous

445
00:16:36,175 --> 00:16:37,476
as the cast
of <i>the Brady bunch.</i>

446
00:16:37,543 --> 00:16:39,678
- I agree with abed.
This is getting creepy.

447
00:16:39,746 --> 00:16:41,847
- No more creepy
than when Jeff wears tight jeans

448
00:16:41,914 --> 00:16:43,348
and you say, "I'd like to slap

449
00:16:43,416 --> 00:16:45,250
those buns on the grill."
both: What?

450
00:16:45,318 --> 00:16:46,318
- First of all,
I don't talk like that,

451
00:16:46,385 --> 00:16:47,452
and second of all,
where I'm from,

452
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:48,754
it's perfectly normal for women

453
00:16:48,821 --> 00:16:50,188
to talk about
their male friends' backsides.

454
00:16:50,256 --> 00:16:51,623
And you don't see me
saying anything crazy

455
00:16:51,691 --> 00:16:53,225
about abed and Troy's
weird little relationship.

456
00:16:53,292 --> 00:16:54,659
Both:
They're just jealous.

457
00:16:54,727 --> 00:16:56,661
- All right, all right,
maybe we're not a family.

458
00:16:56,729 --> 00:17:01,099
Maybe it's more complicated,
because unlike a real family,

459
00:17:01,167 --> 00:17:02,801
there's nothing to stop
any one of us

460
00:17:02,869 --> 00:17:04,536
from looking
at any of the others

461
00:17:04,604 --> 00:17:07,706
as a sexual prospect.

- [Gasps]

463
00:17:36,302 --> 00:17:38,603
- Why are we even talking
about this?

464
00:17:38,671 --> 00:17:41,306
- Because you started having sex
with Britta's ex-boyfriend.

465
00:17:41,374 --> 00:17:43,041
- What?
We haven't even kissed.

466
00:17:43,109 --> 00:17:45,076
- That doesn't mean
you're not having sex.

467
00:17:45,144 --> 00:17:46,711
- Vaughn told me
he would take things

468
00:17:46,779 --> 00:17:47,946
as slowly as I wanted.

469
00:17:48,014 --> 00:17:50,749
He likes me for who I am,
and I like him.

- No.

I threw my phone
into the river.

481
00:18:17,910 --> 00:18:19,411
I thought that, you know,
if I can't be with her,

00:18:19,478 --> 00:18:21,246
who am I gonna call?

483

a lot of soul-searching,
