1
00:00:01,441 --> 00:00:03,075
welcome back!

2
00:00:03,143 --> 00:00:05,877
- Hi.
- Hello.

3
00:00:05,945 --> 00:00:07,279
What did you do over break?
- Hi.

4
00:00:07,346 --> 00:00:08,546
- Oh, it was so awesome.

5
00:00:08,614 --> 00:00:09,679
Me and abed played
this video game.

6
00:00:09,747 --> 00:00:11,641
It is so dope.
It's a whole city.

7
00:00:11,708 --> 00:00:13,196
- You can drive anywhere.
- You can rent an apartment.

8
00:00:13,264 --> 00:00:14,224
- You could do your taxes.
- But don't get audited

9
00:00:14,292 --> 00:00:15,454
'cause that's bad.

10
00:00:15,522 --> 00:00:16,752
- You could even enroll
in community college.

11
00:00:16,815 --> 00:00:19,277
- Right now it sounds
as boring as real life,

12
00:00:19,345 --> 00:00:20,677
But it is not.

13
00:00:20,744 --> 00:00:22,839
- Vacations are wasted
on the young.

14
00:00:22,906 --> 00:00:25,538
You guys gotta get out there
and see the world at some point

15
00:00:25,605 --> 00:00:27,867
Or you're gonna miss
your entire lives.

16
00:00:27,935 --> 00:00:30,133
- Where did you go, britta?
- Amsterdam, I think.

17
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:31,832
I'll know more
when I find my camera.

18
00:00:31,899 --> 00:00:34,098
- Guess what happened
to me.

19
00:00:34,166 --> 00:00:36,762
- Oh, pierce,
you became a grandfather?

20
00:00:36,829 --> 00:00:38,429
- No, I became even cooler.

21
00:00:38,496 --> 00:00:40,529
These ironic tee shirts
are all the rage.

22
00:00:42,096 --> 00:00:43,761
- Let's get one thing
straight.

23
00:00:43,829 --> 00:00:45,062
I wish I was still
a lawyer.

24
00:00:45,129 --> 00:00:46,795
I'm only here because
I'm hot for britta,

25
00:00:46,863 --> 00:00:50,297
And I don't want to be
anybody's friend.

26
00:00:50,365 --> 00:00:51,964
Just kidding.

27
00:00:52,032 --> 00:00:54,600
Bring it in here,
ya knuckleheads!

28
00:00:57,537 --> 00:00:59,936
You know, I gotta say
I took a look back

29
00:01:00,004 --> 00:01:01,738
At the guy I was
last semester,

30
00:01:01,804 --> 00:01:04,604
And I realized
that guy was a drag.

31
00:01:04,672 --> 00:01:05,938
- No...
- Aww...

32
00:01:06,006 --> 00:01:07,439
- Good to hear you
admit it, jeff.

33
00:01:07,507 --> 00:01:09,040
- No, the truth is
this is a new semester,

34
00:01:09,107 --> 00:01:10,407
A new jeff.

35
00:01:10,475 --> 00:01:11,907
Greendale is where I am,

36
00:01:11,975 --> 00:01:13,708
And I am gonna make
the best of it.

37
00:01:13,776 --> 00:01:14,808
- That is nice.

38
00:01:14,876 --> 00:01:15,943
- You're like hawkeye on
m.A.S.H.

39
00:01:16,010 --> 00:01:17,110
He kept his upbeat humor
and charm

40
00:01:17,178 --> 00:01:19,544
Even in the 11th year
of the korean war.

41
00:01:19,612 --> 00:01:20,945
- Yeah, well, don't go changing
too much, jeff.

42
00:01:21,012 --> 00:01:23,647
I think we all like you
just the way you were.

43
00:01:23,714 --> 00:01:26,648
- Well, I appreciate that,
but--

44
00:01:26,716 --> 00:01:27,882
Did you just teleport here?

45
00:01:27,950 --> 00:01:32,318
- No, I snuck in
during the group hug.

46
00:01:32,386 --> 00:01:34,219
You guys don't
remember me?

47
00:01:34,287 --> 00:01:36,654
Buddy...From spanish class?

48
00:01:38,556 --> 00:01:40,222
- I've never seen you before
in my life.

49
00:01:42,224 --> 00:01:43,691
- I've seen buddy before.

50
00:01:43,758 --> 00:01:45,324
He sits in the corner
next to the dead plant.

51
00:01:45,392 --> 00:01:46,825
- Thank you, abed.

52
00:01:46,893 --> 00:01:49,293
Sometimes I have a tendency
to melt into the background.

53
00:01:49,361 --> 00:01:50,561
It's just my body type.

54
00:01:50,629 --> 00:01:52,495
But I definitely know
you guys

55
00:01:52,563 --> 00:01:55,797
From watching you all
last semester grow together.

56
00:01:57,699 --> 00:01:59,832
- "f." "f"-minus.

57
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:01,900
- Did you say "s"?

58
00:02:01,968 --> 00:02:03,702
- He said "f."

59
00:02:03,769 --> 00:02:07,071
- Who cheated?
- I did it.

60
00:02:07,138 --> 00:02:11,007
- Britta cheated?
But why?

61
00:02:11,074 --> 00:02:13,308
- Gimme back my bra,
annie.

62
00:02:13,376 --> 00:02:16,211
- I'm not even wearing a bra.
- Oh!

63
00:02:19,715 --> 00:02:21,880
- I don't even care
who wins.

64
00:02:21,948 --> 00:02:23,348
- What?

65
00:02:23,416 --> 00:02:24,616
- I sleep a lot in class.

66
00:02:24,683 --> 00:02:25,750
That one might have been
a dream.

67
00:02:25,818 --> 00:02:27,851
- Well, buddy,
as you know,

68
00:02:27,919 --> 00:02:29,452
We haven't had
spanish class yet.

69
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,053
So this meeting was more
just for catching up...

70
00:02:31,121 --> 00:02:32,388
Between friends.

71
00:02:32,455 --> 00:02:36,657
- I heard that.
Let's do it!

72
00:02:36,725 --> 00:02:39,625
- Well--
- so--sorry, britta.

73
00:02:39,693 --> 00:02:41,091
I'll go first.

74
00:02:41,159 --> 00:02:44,560
Uh, I'm sure you guys have
a natural rapport and timing,

75
00:02:44,628 --> 00:02:47,629
And, you know, you're scared
that adding a new member

76
00:02:47,697 --> 00:02:49,997
Might throw everything off
of its natural...

77
00:02:50,065 --> 00:02:56,335
- âª I can't count the reasons
I should stay âª

78
00:02:58,171 --> 00:02:59,204
- ...Rhythm.

79
00:02:59,271 --> 00:03:00,972
I feel like I know
you guys already.

80
00:03:01,039 --> 00:03:03,273
So you know, let me in.
Just tell me the rules,

81
00:03:03,341 --> 00:03:04,841
And I will follow.

82
00:03:04,908 --> 00:03:07,242
- Well, you already broke
the only rule I have.

83
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:09,210
The rule about worrying
about rules.

84
00:03:09,278 --> 00:03:12,079
- That's what I'm saying too!

85
00:03:12,147 --> 00:03:13,346
Yeah!

86
00:03:13,414 --> 00:03:15,348
âª spanish studyin' is better âª

87
00:03:15,416 --> 00:03:17,450
âª when you're buddyin' âª

88
00:03:17,517 --> 00:03:25,322
âª around, yeah âª

89
00:03:31,427 --> 00:03:33,695
- Excuse me,
I received a text message

90
00:03:33,762 --> 00:03:35,429
About free sephora samples.

91
00:03:35,497 --> 00:03:37,664
- Ha ha!
It was me.

92
00:03:37,732 --> 00:03:40,666
Sorry about the ruse,
but I have something better

93
00:03:40,734 --> 00:03:43,868
Than exfoliating soap
to rub on you.

94
00:03:43,936 --> 00:03:46,904
An opportunity.
Mm.

95
00:03:46,972 --> 00:03:49,140
As you can see,
I am resurrecting

96
00:03:49,207 --> 00:03:51,542
The greendale gazette
journal mirror!

97
00:03:51,609 --> 00:03:53,209
And we need a student editor.

98
00:03:53,277 --> 00:03:55,110
Someone with real
world savvy

99
00:03:55,178 --> 00:03:56,912
That extends beyond
how to huff the ink.

100
00:03:56,979 --> 00:03:59,046
- Actually, dean, I'm resolved
to spend this semester

101
00:03:59,114 --> 00:04:00,214
Being more...

102
00:04:00,282 --> 00:04:02,482
- This would be your office.

103
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:07,085
- Relaxed...And awesome.

104
00:04:07,153 --> 00:04:08,553
This is the first desk
I've seen in six months

105
00:04:08,621 --> 00:04:10,388
That doesn't have
"zeppelin rules" carved into it.

106
00:04:10,455 --> 00:04:12,056
- And you get
an english credit.

107
00:04:12,123 --> 00:04:14,391
- Well, that ain't bad neither.
I'm in.

108
00:04:14,459 --> 00:04:18,261
- Guys, meet your new editor!

109
00:04:18,329 --> 00:04:20,262
Mr. Winger is very excited
to help you bring a voice

110
00:04:20,330 --> 00:04:21,597
Back to the campus.

111
00:04:21,665 --> 00:04:24,566
- Jeff, I need
to take your picture.

112
00:04:24,634 --> 00:04:26,101
- We got it.
- Okay.

113
00:04:26,168 --> 00:04:28,669
You guys knock yourselves out!

114
00:04:28,737 --> 00:04:30,838
- This is my article on
the school's new water heater.

115
00:04:30,906 --> 00:04:33,307
- You got chops, kid,
but we need your talent

116
00:04:33,374 --> 00:04:35,075
On a bigger story.

117
00:04:35,143 --> 00:04:37,877
Pizza wars--who's got
the best slice in town?

118
00:04:37,945 --> 00:04:40,112
Start with big nick's.
Bring us a large, with sausage.

119
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:43,115
You. I heard a rumor
that riley's liquor is

120
00:04:43,183 --> 00:04:44,316
Selling to underage students.

121
00:04:44,384 --> 00:04:46,318
I need an undercover expose.

122
00:04:46,386 --> 00:04:48,119
Find out how much
they'll sell you

123
00:04:48,187 --> 00:04:49,420
Of anything cold
and imported.

124
00:04:49,488 --> 00:04:52,123
- You expect me
to watch you do that

125
00:04:52,191 --> 00:04:53,324
Without telling on you?

126
00:04:53,392 --> 00:04:55,359
- That's a hard-hitting
question, annie.

127
00:04:55,427 --> 00:04:56,627
Are you a reporter?

128
00:04:56,695 --> 00:04:58,428
- No, they've got me editing
the crossword

129
00:04:58,496 --> 00:04:59,696
Because I'm a girl.

130
00:04:59,764 --> 00:05:01,031
And because I love crosswords.

131
00:05:01,098 --> 00:05:02,866
- Well, now you love
the streets.

132
00:05:02,934 --> 00:05:04,434
You're my ace news hound.

133
00:05:04,502 --> 00:05:05,802
- Ace? You can do that?

134
00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:08,271
- We can do anything we want.
It's greendale.

135
00:05:08,339 --> 00:05:11,307
Now go find me that story.

136
00:05:11,375 --> 00:05:14,009
- This character reboot is
really gelling for you, jeff.

137
00:05:14,077 --> 00:05:15,210
That was all classic hawkeye.

138
00:05:15,278 --> 00:05:16,578
Sending soldiers out
for liquor.

139
00:05:16,646 --> 00:05:18,680
Slyly sidestepping
the problematic scrutiny

140
00:05:18,747 --> 00:05:20,915
Of annie "hot lips" edison.

141
00:05:20,983 --> 00:05:23,317
I should build you a still
for making hawkeye martinis.

142
00:05:23,384 --> 00:05:25,652
- Of all your pop culture
fixations,

143
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:27,621
This is one I can
work with, abed.

144
00:05:27,688 --> 00:05:30,523
- Call me radar.
- When you've earned it.

145
00:05:30,591 --> 00:05:33,993
Now, I know the news
of senor chang's death

146
00:05:34,061 --> 00:05:36,395
Over winter break
was a shock to us all.

147
00:05:36,463 --> 00:05:39,431
But we should take comfort
in the fact

148
00:05:39,499 --> 00:05:41,066
That he did not suffer

149
00:05:41,134 --> 00:05:43,135
When his moped hit the side
of that arby's.

150
00:05:43,202 --> 00:05:45,003
- So sad.

151
00:05:45,071 --> 00:05:47,706
But best semester ever.

152
00:05:50,576 --> 00:05:53,243
Feliz ano nueva, chicas!

153
00:05:53,311 --> 00:05:57,012
beat it. All right.

154
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:58,247
That was a professional
actress.

155
00:05:58,314 --> 00:06:02,717
I am a man
who can never die.

156
00:06:02,785 --> 00:06:04,352
And this has been
your first taste

157
00:06:04,419 --> 00:06:05,919
Of spanish 1-0- dos--

158
00:06:05,987 --> 00:06:10,657
The semester I get inside
your cabesas!

159
00:06:21,233 --> 00:06:29,739
âª âª

160
00:06:29,806 --> 00:06:32,174
- I saw that coming.

161
00:06:32,242 --> 00:06:34,743
- Hey, guys,
see you in study group.

162
00:06:34,810 --> 00:06:36,911
Hoo-ah!

163
00:06:36,979 --> 00:06:38,380
Ah!

164
00:06:38,447 --> 00:06:42,384
- Uh, jeff, can he really
just decide he's one of us?

165
00:06:42,452 --> 00:06:44,119
- He throws off our balance.

166
00:06:44,187 --> 00:06:46,054
We've got three chicks,
three dudes,

167
00:06:46,122 --> 00:06:47,722
And now two weirdos.

168
00:06:47,790 --> 00:06:49,156
Sorry, abed.

169
00:06:49,224 --> 00:06:50,491
- Not all weirdos are bad.

170
00:06:50,559 --> 00:06:51,825
But he might be
a puckish agent of change

171
00:06:51,893 --> 00:06:52,893
That changes our lives
for the better

172
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:53,893
Through a musical montage.

173
00:06:53,961 --> 00:06:55,361
- Or he could have
a row of jars

174
00:06:55,429 --> 00:06:56,596
Waiting for our genitals.

175
00:06:56,663 --> 00:06:58,263
- Yo, I need my genitals.

176
00:06:58,331 --> 00:07:00,432
- You know who
you guys sound like?

177
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:02,133
Me, from last semester.

178
00:07:02,201 --> 00:07:04,302
Cynical, elitist,

179
00:07:04,370 --> 00:07:06,170
Rakishly good-looking.
- Thank you.

180
00:07:06,238 --> 00:07:07,605
- Well, we should at least
get together

181
00:07:07,673 --> 00:07:09,606
To talk about
membership policies, right?

182
00:07:09,674 --> 00:07:11,008
- Hey, don't ask me.

183
00:07:11,075 --> 00:07:13,543
Dealing with problems
ain't my job no more.

184
00:07:13,611 --> 00:07:16,312
My new job is hanging out,
having fun,

185
00:07:16,379 --> 00:07:17,613
And cracking wise.

186
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:18,780
- Oh, it must be nice.

187
00:07:18,848 --> 00:07:20,282
Suppose I decide
that's my job.

188
00:07:22,551 --> 00:07:25,886
- 'cause you're hilarious!

189
00:07:28,156 --> 00:07:30,757
- Jeff, I hope you've got
an army of raisins

190
00:07:30,825 --> 00:07:33,559
Because I've got
a major scoop.

191
00:07:33,626 --> 00:07:34,860
In October,

192
00:07:34,928 --> 00:07:36,795
There was a free toni braxton
concert on the quad.

193
00:07:36,863 --> 00:07:37,863
- You don't need
to remind me.

194
00:07:37,930 --> 00:07:38,897
- And when a last-minute mix-up

195
00:07:38,965 --> 00:07:40,498
Shifted the show time
by an hour,

196
00:07:40,566 --> 00:07:41,866
An anonymous text message
went out

197
00:07:41,934 --> 00:07:43,267
Alerting students
of the change.

198
00:07:43,335 --> 00:07:45,669
- Okay.
- Not okay.

199
00:07:45,737 --> 00:07:47,671
Because the text message
was sent exclusively

200
00:07:47,738 --> 00:07:49,105
To black students...

201
00:07:49,173 --> 00:07:51,974
And one french kid named lebron.
That's profiling.

202
00:07:52,042 --> 00:07:53,475
This is front-page juice.

203
00:07:53,543 --> 00:07:55,544
Just gotta find out
who sent the text.

204
00:07:55,612 --> 00:07:57,212
- Have you called the number
that sent it?

205
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:01,883
- Well...Nobody's that stupid,
right?

206
00:08:01,950 --> 00:08:05,919
- Aw...

207
00:08:05,987 --> 00:08:09,590
Hello? Um...

208
00:08:09,657 --> 00:08:13,527
wrong number.

209
00:08:16,663 --> 00:08:18,998
No, that--
that was a good cover.

210
00:08:19,066 --> 00:08:21,567
- So whoever it is
keeps hanging up,

211
00:08:21,635 --> 00:08:23,669
But he can't hide forever.

212
00:08:23,736 --> 00:08:27,672
- Annie the reporter.
Good times.

213
00:08:27,739 --> 00:08:30,874
Listen up.
I just want to say

214
00:08:30,942 --> 00:08:34,311
Thank you guys real much--
much--real much? Duh!

215
00:08:34,378 --> 00:08:37,213
Thank you guys very much
for this.

216
00:08:37,281 --> 00:08:39,182
It's a dream come true.

217
00:08:39,249 --> 00:08:40,983
Oh...

218
00:08:41,051 --> 00:08:42,051
- Now let's study
some spanish.

219
00:08:42,118 --> 00:08:45,753
- So for the essay,
we conjugate...

220
00:08:45,821 --> 00:08:50,191
- Conjugate.
Conjugal visit!

221
00:08:50,258 --> 00:08:51,892
lame.

222
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:54,327
Okay, stick and move.
Stick and move.

223
00:08:54,395 --> 00:08:58,431
- Okay, so for the essay
portion...

224
00:08:58,499 --> 00:09:01,000
- âª annie got an essay portion âª

225
00:09:01,068 --> 00:09:03,569
âª annie gonna move
her luscious fanny âª

226
00:09:03,637 --> 00:09:05,671
âª all day long âª

227
00:09:05,739 --> 00:09:07,807
- Hey, buddy can sing,
you guys.

228
00:09:07,875 --> 00:09:09,175
Wow, that's great.

229
00:09:09,243 --> 00:09:13,280
Annie's pretty young.
We try not to sexualize her.

230
00:09:13,347 --> 00:09:16,016
- I'm sorry. Whoa!

231
00:09:16,083 --> 00:09:17,783
Okay, look, I--
you know what,

232
00:09:17,851 --> 00:09:19,184
It's your study group,

233
00:09:19,252 --> 00:09:21,085
And I don't know
if you perceive it

234
00:09:21,153 --> 00:09:22,085
As something that could
be improved,

235
00:09:22,153 --> 00:09:23,186
But I do have some ideas.

236
00:09:23,254 --> 00:09:24,784
Here's the one right here.
Boom.

237
00:09:24,852 --> 00:09:26,184
I was thinking, as a group,

238
00:09:26,252 --> 00:09:27,852
We could start saying,
"you go, girl."

239
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:29,453
Not in a way that's,
you know,

240
00:09:29,521 --> 00:09:31,922
"oh, I'm so cool saying
"you go, girl."

241
00:09:31,989 --> 00:09:33,289
But in a way that
we're kinda winking at it.

242
00:09:33,357 --> 00:09:37,559
Bottom line, you guys need
a chubby, agile guy.

243
00:09:37,627 --> 00:09:39,760
Did anyone see paul blart:
Marl co--

244
00:09:42,430 --> 00:09:43,797
I'm like that, okay?

245
00:09:43,865 --> 00:09:47,533
I'm fat and I'm...
Physical, okay?

246
00:09:47,601 --> 00:09:49,402
And I'm strong. Hmm?
And I can kick.

247
00:09:49,470 --> 00:09:51,037
- Oh!

248
00:09:51,105 --> 00:09:53,239
Ow...Oh...
- Ooh, sorry.

249
00:09:53,306 --> 00:09:55,708
Jeff--
- no, no, it's fine, it's fine.

250
00:09:55,776 --> 00:09:57,409
It's just a little nosebleed.

251
00:09:57,477 --> 00:09:58,544
I get 'em when it's dry

252
00:09:58,611 --> 00:10:00,245
And when my face
gets kicked.

253
00:10:00,313 --> 00:10:01,980
- I'll get some paper towels.

254
00:10:05,450 --> 00:10:07,118
- Did someone say something
about a meeting

255
00:10:07,185 --> 00:10:09,653
To discuss member policy?

256
00:10:13,947 --> 00:10:15,180
Well, I think it's obvious
to everyone

257
00:10:15,248 --> 00:10:17,382
That this buddy fellow
has a few froot loops loose.

258
00:10:17,449 --> 00:10:18,616
So I think no matter
what we do,

259
00:10:18,684 --> 00:10:20,918
We gotta do it with grace
and caution.

260
00:10:20,986 --> 00:10:22,719
- I say we keep buddy
in the group.

261
00:10:22,787 --> 00:10:24,387
- What?

262
00:10:24,455 --> 00:10:25,521
- I've given it a lot of
thought, and frankly

263
00:10:25,589 --> 00:10:27,456
I like his
in-your-face style.

264
00:10:27,524 --> 00:10:29,124
- I can't stop thinking
about his high kick.

265
00:10:29,192 --> 00:10:31,325
His ratio of girth
to hip flexibility

266
00:10:31,393 --> 00:10:32,926
Is mesmerizing.

267
00:10:32,994 --> 00:10:35,161
- I like his idea of ironically
saying "you go, girl."

268
00:10:35,229 --> 00:10:36,695
- You go, girl.
- You go, girl.

269
00:10:36,763 --> 00:10:38,896
- Wait, so you kick high enough
and you get in the group?

270
00:10:38,964 --> 00:10:40,164
- If we're going to add
people,

271
00:10:40,232 --> 00:10:41,898
I really think we should
consider my friend gary.

272
00:10:41,966 --> 00:10:42,999
- I'm sorry, shirley,

273
00:10:43,067 --> 00:10:45,234
Your friend gary is
so boring.

274
00:10:45,302 --> 00:10:46,870
- He was raised in finland.

275
00:10:46,938 --> 00:10:48,339
He doesn't get our humor.

276
00:10:48,406 --> 00:10:49,473
- Well, if we're gonna
add a chair

277
00:10:49,541 --> 00:10:52,145
For every bong-ripping
good-time charlie

278
00:10:52,213 --> 00:10:53,714
With a song in his heart,

279
00:10:53,782 --> 00:10:55,316
I move we institute hazing.

280
00:10:55,384 --> 00:10:57,484
- Well, in the right stuff,
the novel by tom wolfe--

281
00:10:57,552 --> 00:10:58,718
- This is why we need
new blood.

282
00:10:58,786 --> 00:11:00,386
I'm so bored of you
pop culture references

283
00:11:00,454 --> 00:11:01,854
And your cigarette-legged
jeans.

284
00:11:01,922 --> 00:11:04,690
- My friend gary wears nothing
but loose-fitting jeans.

285
00:11:04,758 --> 00:11:07,025
- Gary is off the table.
He is a buzz kill.

286
00:11:07,093 --> 00:11:08,994
- He grew up in a land
without sun!

287
00:11:10,829 --> 00:11:12,697
- Why don't you like
my tight jeans?

288
00:11:12,764 --> 00:11:14,331
- Take a vote.

289
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:15,332
- They'll probably
vote him in.

290
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:16,700
- They won't.

291
00:11:16,768 --> 00:11:19,670
- Guys, guys,
let's take a vote.

292
00:11:19,738 --> 00:11:21,805
- Secret vote.
Everybody cover your eyes.

293
00:11:23,674 --> 00:11:25,942
- We won't know the result.
- Well, say your vote out loud.

294
00:11:26,010 --> 00:11:27,443
- We'll know each other's
voices.

295
00:11:27,511 --> 00:11:28,845
- Troy's got a point.

296
00:11:28,913 --> 00:11:30,380
- Holy crap. Wow.

297
00:11:30,447 --> 00:11:32,348
It says here some guy
in seattle went nuts

298
00:11:32,416 --> 00:11:33,917
And killed his entire
driver's ed class

299
00:11:33,985 --> 00:11:35,852
With a meat tenderizer.

300
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:40,223
- Oh, no.
We have to be careful.

301
00:11:40,291 --> 00:11:43,559
- Okay...
On the count of three,

302
00:11:43,627 --> 00:11:45,628
Everybody who wants
to keep buddy out,

303
00:11:45,696 --> 00:11:48,130
Raise your hand.

304
00:11:54,938 --> 00:11:56,205
- You lied about the guy
in seattle

305
00:11:56,273 --> 00:11:59,108
With the meat tenderizer.

306
00:11:59,176 --> 00:12:01,810
You put your thumb
on the scale.

307
00:12:01,878 --> 00:12:02,945
But you did it with a smile,

308
00:12:03,012 --> 00:12:04,813
And you did it
so you could keep smiling.

309
00:12:04,881 --> 00:12:05,814
You're hawkeye.

310
00:12:05,882 --> 00:12:07,883
- And with buddy gone,

311
00:12:07,951 --> 00:12:10,052
Staying that way will be
a lot easier.

312
00:12:10,119 --> 00:12:12,054
- I am not racist!

313
00:12:12,121 --> 00:12:14,322
I had 20 minutes
to let people know

314
00:12:14,390 --> 00:12:15,791
That toni braxton was
starting early

315
00:12:15,858 --> 00:12:19,695
And 273 text messages left
before my rate tripled.

316
00:12:19,762 --> 00:12:21,496
Racial profiling
may not be right,

317
00:12:21,564 --> 00:12:22,831
But it can be economical.

318
00:12:22,899 --> 00:12:24,933
- Tell me, dean, when I refer
to you in my article,

319
00:12:25,001 --> 00:12:26,635
Would you prefer "imbecile"
or "incompetent?"

320
00:12:26,702 --> 00:12:28,970
- I prefer "incompetent,"
but what I really want--

321
00:12:29,038 --> 00:12:30,304
- It doesn't matter
what you want.

322
00:12:30,372 --> 00:12:32,840
The people want the truth.
I have to give it to them.

323
00:12:32,908 --> 00:12:36,644
And I won't let anyone
stand in my way.

324
00:12:36,711 --> 00:12:38,445
- Excuse me.

325
00:12:38,513 --> 00:12:41,114
- Okay.
- Thank you.

326
00:12:41,182 --> 00:12:42,816
Jeffrey, I am the least
racist person in the world.

327
00:12:42,884 --> 00:12:47,120
My best friend when I was
six years old was a black man.

328
00:12:47,188 --> 00:12:48,955
Look, I've learned my lesson.
I've got unlimited texting now.

329
00:12:49,023 --> 00:12:51,857
But if she runs that story,
I will lose this job.

330
00:12:51,924 --> 00:12:54,592
And this job is my life.

331
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:56,661
She listens to you.

332
00:12:56,729 --> 00:13:00,765
- Well, next time we're both
hanging out having fun

333
00:13:00,833 --> 00:13:04,701
I could try cracking wise
about it with her.

334
00:13:04,769 --> 00:13:05,869
- You do what you think
is right.

335
00:13:12,609 --> 00:13:16,944
âª âª

336
00:13:17,012 --> 00:13:18,312
- That's enough.
- Okay.

337
00:13:18,379 --> 00:13:20,546
- I'm just saying it's not
exactly watergate.

338
00:13:20,614 --> 00:13:22,148
I mean, you like the dean.

339
00:13:22,215 --> 00:13:23,782
He's trying to help you
transfer.

340
00:13:23,850 --> 00:13:25,717
- Yeah, and this time
he might succeed.

341
00:13:25,784 --> 00:13:27,284
If this article breaks out,

342
00:13:27,352 --> 00:13:29,486
I can apply
for journalism scholarships.

343
00:13:29,553 --> 00:13:31,086
Nobody will care about
my time in rehab

344
00:13:31,154 --> 00:13:32,154
If they think I'm a writer.

345
00:13:32,221 --> 00:13:34,121
- Annie,
as your upbeat friend,

346
00:13:34,189 --> 00:13:35,655
I gotta say let this go.

347
00:13:35,723 --> 00:13:39,124
- This is greendale, jeff.
We can do whatever we want.

348
00:13:49,971 --> 00:13:53,106
- Didn't anyone tell buddy
he was out?

349
00:13:53,174 --> 00:13:54,375
- I guess we thought
you would.

350
00:13:57,480 --> 00:14:00,515
- Milord, milady.
You missed my apology song.

351
00:14:00,582 --> 00:14:02,916
- Yeah, I'll tell 'em
about it later.

352
00:14:02,984 --> 00:14:05,217
- Jeff...

353
00:14:05,285 --> 00:14:07,719
I am so sorry about
the other day.

354
00:14:07,787 --> 00:14:12,624
- Buddy, yesterday
the group took a vote.

355
00:14:15,328 --> 00:14:18,663
- And you seem to have
figured out the rest of it.

356
00:14:22,901 --> 00:14:25,969
Was it the high kick?
Was it "you go, girl"?

357
00:14:26,037 --> 00:14:27,904
Oh, you guys think
you're so cool.

358
00:14:27,971 --> 00:14:29,372
- No, we don't think
we're cool at all.

359
00:14:29,439 --> 00:14:30,439
- A little bit.

360
00:14:30,507 --> 00:14:32,775
- I put myself out there
for you!

361
00:14:32,842 --> 00:14:37,045
I laid my soul bare!

362
00:14:37,113 --> 00:14:40,181
I made you guys lemon squares
with free-range eggs

363
00:14:40,249 --> 00:14:41,782
That I baked
with my own hands.

364
00:14:41,850 --> 00:14:43,717
- Maybe a little less sugar
next time.

365
00:14:43,785 --> 00:14:45,886
- Well, I'm not leaving.

366
00:14:45,953 --> 00:14:50,123
- Oh, come on.
Be relaxed, like me.

367
00:14:50,190 --> 00:14:52,291
Leave.
- You're not relaxed.

368
00:14:52,359 --> 00:14:54,359
You're an uptight
puppet master,

369
00:14:54,427 --> 00:14:55,360
And these are all
your little puppets.

370
00:15:00,165 --> 00:15:03,600
- Buddy, just be reasonable
and go.

371
00:15:03,668 --> 00:15:06,236
Make me...Hitler.

372
00:15:06,304 --> 00:15:08,805
- Okay, so since buddy's
not leaving,

373
00:15:08,873 --> 00:15:12,074
He'll just be the person who
we wish wasn't here

374
00:15:12,142 --> 00:15:13,275
While we study.

375
00:15:13,343 --> 00:15:16,077
Try getting that deal
from hitler. Shall we?

376
00:15:18,547 --> 00:15:22,750
- I'm studying with you.
- No, you're not.

377
00:15:22,817 --> 00:15:24,651
Everyone stop studying.

378
00:15:24,719 --> 00:15:26,286
- Okay.

379
00:15:26,354 --> 00:15:29,188
- You're not in the group.

380
00:15:29,256 --> 00:15:32,657
- Okay, then go study
somewhere else.

381
00:15:32,725 --> 00:15:35,326
Hola, mi amigo.

382
00:15:35,394 --> 00:15:38,462
Donde estas la bibliota?

383
00:15:51,307 --> 00:15:54,075
No, no.
No, no, no, no!

384
00:15:54,143 --> 00:15:55,610
No, no, no!

385
00:15:55,677 --> 00:15:57,411
No, I want to study spanish!

386
00:15:57,479 --> 00:15:59,647
No!

387
00:15:59,715 --> 00:16:02,750
Noooooooooo!

388
00:16:07,188 --> 00:16:10,690
Ah, I hate you!

389
00:16:10,758 --> 00:16:14,427
I hate your study group!
I hate it!

390
00:16:14,495 --> 00:16:17,963
You suck! Aah...

391
00:16:18,030 --> 00:16:19,698
<i>I hate you!</i>

392
00:16:23,368 --> 00:16:24,969
- And you are not running
that story!

393
00:16:25,037 --> 00:16:28,172
- Why not?
- Because I said so!

394
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:31,809
Does anybody have a problem
with how that was handled?

395
00:16:31,877 --> 00:16:33,411
- It's exactly the way
I would have done it, jeff.

396
00:16:40,198 --> 00:16:42,365
- Who are you kidding, abed?

397
00:16:42,433 --> 00:16:44,734
I just dragged a screaming,
crying man

398
00:16:44,802 --> 00:16:47,903
Out of a library
with his pants down.

399
00:16:47,971 --> 00:16:50,772
No. Martinis are for hawkeyes.

400
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:54,942
I'm the same uptight jerk
I was last semester.

401
00:16:58,079 --> 00:17:00,580
- Jeff, what's your favorite
episode of m.A.S.H.?

402
00:17:00,648 --> 00:17:03,616
- The one with, uh,
the army.

403
00:17:03,684 --> 00:17:05,551
- That's what I thought.

404
00:17:05,619 --> 00:17:07,420
If you'd ever actually seen
the show,

405
00:17:07,487 --> 00:17:08,421
You'd know that hawkeye
doesn't just bed nurses

406
00:17:08,488 --> 00:17:09,655
And drink martinis.

407
00:17:09,723 --> 00:17:10,923
He also had blood
sprayed on his face

408
00:17:10,991 --> 00:17:12,825
And barked orders
when the choppers came in.

409
00:17:12,893 --> 00:17:15,628
If he didn't,
people died.

410
00:17:15,695 --> 00:17:17,696
He was a leader, jeff.
That's your job.

411
00:17:17,764 --> 00:17:20,265
- Ooh.
What's in it for me?

412
00:17:20,333 --> 00:17:21,533
- Hey...

413
00:17:21,601 --> 00:17:24,870
- Annie, I'm sorry that
I yelled.

414
00:17:24,937 --> 00:17:26,871
- I'm glad you did.

415
00:17:26,939 --> 00:17:28,874
It didn't even really
occur to me what I was doing

416
00:17:28,942 --> 00:17:32,478
Until I saw how upset
you were.

417
00:17:32,545 --> 00:17:33,945
And I never want to be
the reason you're mad

418
00:17:34,013 --> 00:17:39,451
Because...
You're jeff winger.

419
00:17:39,519 --> 00:17:43,054
So...Thanks...
For getting mad.

420
00:17:43,122 --> 00:17:46,524
- Well, it was nothing.

421
00:17:48,962 --> 00:17:50,629
I guess that's
the upside, isn't it?

422
00:17:58,907 --> 00:18:02,411
Thank you...Radar.

423
00:18:02,479 --> 00:18:04,547
- Ooh, you made me so happy
I just peed a little.

424
00:18:07,284 --> 00:18:09,051
- I don't think violence
is the answer

425
00:18:09,119 --> 00:18:10,052
When we make decisions
about--

426
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:11,153
- Oh!

427
00:18:11,221 --> 00:18:12,888
- Hi, guys.

428
00:18:12,955 --> 00:18:14,823
- Hi, buddy.
Can you, um...

429
00:18:14,890 --> 00:18:17,192
- Excuse us...

430
00:18:17,259 --> 00:18:20,130
- For one...
Crazy stalker?

431
00:18:25,237 --> 00:18:26,404
- Listen up.

432
00:18:26,472 --> 00:18:28,840
We outnumber this guy
six to one.

433
00:18:28,908 --> 00:18:32,077
Annie, you flash your breasts
as a decoy for the bum rush.

434
00:18:32,145 --> 00:18:33,945
- Pierce!
- Don't be upset.

435
00:18:34,013 --> 00:18:36,248
I didn't pick you as a decoy
'cause your breasts are so old.

436
00:18:36,315 --> 00:18:38,283
- Why is he even here?
Hello.

437
00:18:38,351 --> 00:18:40,118
- I invited him.

438
00:18:42,989 --> 00:18:46,125
Buddy's crime is thinking
we're cool.

439
00:18:46,193 --> 00:18:47,727
But I get it.

440
00:18:47,795 --> 00:18:49,329
I mean, if I were him

441
00:18:49,396 --> 00:18:51,364
And I missed out
on you guys,

442
00:18:51,432 --> 00:18:54,067
I'd be sitting
in that classroom,

443
00:18:54,135 --> 00:18:57,070
Watching, wondering.

444
00:18:57,138 --> 00:18:59,906
So how can I exclude someone
from something

445
00:18:59,974 --> 00:19:01,741
That I'm so lucky to have?

446
00:19:01,809 --> 00:19:03,110
- Oh...

447
00:19:03,177 --> 00:19:06,447
- I say we let him in.

448
00:19:08,516 --> 00:19:10,551
Hi, buddy.

449
00:19:10,618 --> 00:19:13,053
Welcome to the group.

450
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:16,488
- Oh, yes!

451
00:19:16,556 --> 00:19:18,089
You will not regret this.

452
00:19:20,459 --> 00:19:21,659
- There he is.

453
00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:23,894
Speak of the devil,
he's right there.

454
00:19:23,962 --> 00:19:26,964
- Hey, buddy.
- Hmm?

455
00:19:27,031 --> 00:19:28,131
- The group thought about
what you said.

456
00:19:28,199 --> 00:19:30,500
We took a vote, and you're in.

457
00:19:30,568 --> 00:19:34,337
- Oh ho, no way!
I'm in the cool group?

458
00:19:34,404 --> 00:19:35,571
- Look at him.

459
00:19:35,639 --> 00:19:37,905
It's like christmas morning
for the guy.

460
00:19:37,973 --> 00:19:39,340
Welcome.

461
00:19:39,408 --> 00:19:42,075
- Oh...This is--

462
00:19:42,143 --> 00:19:45,044
Oh, this is awkward.

463
00:19:45,111 --> 00:19:47,446
You guys were my safe date.

464
00:19:47,513 --> 00:19:49,547
- Hey, buddy, you don't have
to worry about them.

465
00:19:49,615 --> 00:19:51,082
You're with us now.
Come on.

466
00:19:51,150 --> 00:19:53,451
- Ha ha! Boom!

467
00:19:53,519 --> 00:19:56,353
- I love the kicks.
- He's amazing!

468
00:19:56,421 --> 00:19:57,688
- The kicks are the best.

469
00:19:57,756 --> 00:19:59,289
He's just got that kind of--

470
00:19:59,357 --> 00:20:01,825
You know when
some people have it...

471
00:20:05,027 --> 00:20:06,927
- And that, ladies
and gentlemen,

472
00:20:06,995 --> 00:20:08,495
Is why I voted to keep him.

473
00:20:08,563 --> 00:20:10,096
- It would have been nice
to have

474
00:20:10,164 --> 00:20:11,497
Another person
in the group.

475
00:20:11,564 --> 00:20:13,231
- I'll call gary.

9999
