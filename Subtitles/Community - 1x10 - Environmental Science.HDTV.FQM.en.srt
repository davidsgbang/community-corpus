2
00:00:02,017 --> 00:00:02,851
Okay, you can
hear this? okay.

3
00:00:02,917 --> 00:00:04,584
Good morning.

4
00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:07,917
I'm here to kick off
the first day of new tradition

5
00:00:07,984 --> 00:00:10,784
At our school called
"green week."	|Dean All	|01

6
00:00:10,851 --> 00:00:12,751
- what?

7
00:00:12,817 --> 00:00:14,283
First, we give a month
to black history,

8
00:00:14,350 --> 00:00:16,118
Now we're blowing
seven days on the irish.	|Pierce Group	|01

9
00:00:16,184 --> 00:00:18,484
- all this week,
greendale college

10
00:00:18,550 --> 00:00:20,884
Is becoming so earth-smart

11
00:00:20,951 --> 00:00:23,984
That we're changing
our name to envirodale!	|Dean All	|01

13
00:00:26,184 --> 00:00:29,051
- but we were already
called greendale.	|Starburns Dean	|01

15
00:00:32,218 --> 00:00:36,283
Well, there's, um,
also going to be

16
00:00:36,350 --> 00:00:38,684
A free
rock and roll concert

17
00:00:38,751 --> 00:00:42,550
By a certain band
called green day.

19
00:00:44,584 --> 00:00:45,917
Huh?
that make you happy?	|Dean All	|01

20
00:00:45,984 --> 00:00:47,184
- eh, no. not really.	|Starburns Dean	|01

21
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:49,050
- okay,
we need to redo these.	|Dean Assistant	|01

22
00:00:49,117 --> 00:00:50,384
- we printed 5,000.	|Assistant Dean	|01

23
00:00:50,451 --> 00:00:52,050
- well, print 5,000 more.

24
00:00:52,117 --> 00:00:53,217
I'm trying to save
the planet, here.	|Dean Assistant	|01

25
00:01:01,817 --> 00:01:03,750
- pencils down.	|Chang All	|02

27
00:01:36,967 --> 00:01:40,300
I want you all to write
a one-page essay,

28
00:01:40,367 --> 00:01:43,101
in espanol, entitled,
annie's mistake.	|Chang All	|02

29
00:01:46,068 --> 00:01:48,600
- why doesn't annie
have to write it?	|Pierce Chang	|02

30
00:01:48,667 --> 00:01:52,534
- okay, two pages,
entitled,

31
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:54,967
the consequences
of questioning authority.	|Chang All	|02

32
00:01:55,034 --> 00:01:56,801
- this is spanish 101.

33
00:01:56,867 --> 00:01:57,967
I know how to say
"hello," "tomorrow,"

34
00:01:58,034 --> 00:01:59,068
And that tables
are female.

35
00:01:59,134 --> 00:02:00,300
That's the only spanish
you taught us.	|Shirley Chang	|02

36
00:02:00,367 --> 00:02:04,967
- oh, six pages
on ignorance.	|Chang All	|02

37
00:02:05,034 --> 00:02:07,168
- guys,
put your hands down.	|Britta All	|02

38
00:02:07,233 --> 00:02:10,467
Senor chang, please continue.
we respect your authority.	|Britta Chang	|02

39
00:02:10,534 --> 00:02:11,734
- thank you, britta.	|Chang Britta	|02

40
00:02:11,801 --> 00:02:14,267
20 pages on ass kissing!

41
00:02:14,333 --> 00:02:16,101
Due on monday.	|Chang All	|02

42
00:02:16,168 --> 00:02:17,600
- this monday?	|Annie Chang	|02

44
00:02:23,867 --> 00:02:26,034
- you know, if senor chang
gets any crazier,

45
00:02:26,101 --> 00:02:28,068
He's gonna win
one of those grammy awards.	|Pierce Group	|03

47
00:02:32,068 --> 00:02:34,101
- i've already
reported him to the dean.

48
00:02:34,168 --> 00:02:35,600
He said they've been trying
to fire him for three years,

49
00:02:35,667 --> 00:02:37,068
But nobody wants his job.	|Annie Group	|03

50
00:02:37,134 --> 00:02:39,500
- mm-mm, i can't write
a 20-page paper.

51
00:02:39,567 --> 00:02:41,333
I got a presentation
in my marketing class on friday

52
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:44,101
And public speaking gives me
the nervous sweats.	|Shirley Group	|03

53
00:02:44,168 --> 00:02:45,500
- i can help you
with that.	|Pierce Shirley	|03

54
00:02:45,567 --> 00:02:47,034
- i accept.	|Shirley Pierce	|03

55
00:02:47,101 --> 00:02:48,767
That's how messed up
things are.	|Shirley Group	|03

56
00:02:48,834 --> 00:02:50,467
- well,
we're screwed too.

57
00:02:50,534 --> 00:02:52,734
We're three days behind
on our biology lab.	|Troy Group	|03

58
00:02:52,801 --> 00:02:54,034
- the reason it's taking so long
is because troy's afraid--	|Abed Group	|03

59
00:02:54,101 --> 00:02:56,333
- i'm not afraid, abed.

60
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:59,667
I choose not to be around rats
because they are unpopular.

61
00:02:59,734 --> 00:03:01,467
Same goes for centipedes
and lakes.	|Troy Abed	|03

62
00:03:01,534 --> 00:03:02,901
- there's only one solution.

63
00:03:02,967 --> 00:03:05,300
Someone has to go to chang
and talk to him.	|Britta Group	|03

64
00:03:05,367 --> 00:03:07,333
- i vote we all look at jeff
at the same time.	|Annie Group	|03

65
00:03:11,168 --> 00:03:14,068
- in a way,
all of you are right.

66
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:16,034
Okay, what
was i tuning out?	|Jeff Group	|03

67
00:03:16,101 --> 00:03:18,634
- you have to get chang to
call off some of this homework.

68
00:03:18,701 --> 00:03:19,934
You're the one
with the silver tongue.	|Annie Jeff	|03

69
00:03:20,001 --> 00:03:22,067
- yeah, go tongue chang.	|Pierce Jeff	|03

70
00:03:22,134 --> 00:03:24,234
- guys, what makes you think
i can convince chang of anything

71
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:26,900
If i can't even convince you
not to make me do it?	|Jeff Group	|03

72
00:03:26,967 --> 00:03:28,267
- i guess it sounds crazy.	|Britta Group 	|03
- oh...	|Annie Group	|03

73
00:03:28,334 --> 00:03:30,067
- jeff does raise a good point.	|Troy Group	|03
- i don't get it.	|Pierce Group	|03

74
00:03:30,134 --> 00:03:31,868
- wait,
you are convincing!	|Troy Jeff	|03

76
00:03:33,234 --> 00:03:34,634
- you just made us change.
you could do it.	|Shirley Jeff	|03

77
00:03:34,701 --> 00:03:37,534
- you want me
to risk the "c"

78
00:03:37,601 --> 00:03:39,200
That i'm pulling
in that psycho's class

79
00:03:39,267 --> 00:03:40,801
By putting myself
on his radar?

80
00:03:40,868 --> 00:03:41,801
I mean, that guy
goes any more nuts,

81
00:03:41,868 --> 00:03:43,100
He's gonna win a grammy.	|Jeff Group	|03

82
00:03:43,167 --> 00:03:44,300
- you are hilarious.	|Troy Jeff	|03

83
00:03:44,367 --> 00:03:45,768
- that's very funny.	|Abed Group	|03
- he's funny.	|Shirley Group	|03

84
00:03:45,834 --> 00:03:46,967
- what is it,
the chair?	|Pierce Group	|03

85
00:03:47,033 --> 00:03:47,601
- jeff, how do you think

86
00:03:47,667 --> 00:03:49,267
You're gonna keep pulling
a "c" in that psycho's class

87
00:03:49,334 --> 00:03:51,000
If he keeps assigning
this much work?	|Britta Jeff	|03

88
00:03:51,067 --> 00:03:55,300
- because
i have you guys.	|Jeff Group	|03

89
00:03:55,367 --> 00:03:57,768
- well, guess what,
handsome hobo.

90
00:03:57,834 --> 00:04:00,434
Your gravy train's
leavin' the station.	|Annie Jeff	|03

92
00:04:03,567 --> 00:04:05,634
- ignore what she's doing.
we are serious.	|Troy Jeff	|03

93
00:04:05,701 --> 00:04:08,267
- fine. i'll do it.

94
00:04:08,334 --> 00:04:11,601
But when you find my body,
don't believe the suicide note.	|Jeff Group	|03

95
00:04:16,933 --> 00:04:19,967
- hmm. this better not
awaken anything in me.	|Dean	|04

96
00:04:20,033 --> 00:04:21,768
- green day's here.	|Assistant Dean	|05

97
00:04:21,834 --> 00:04:23,234
- oh, wow.

98
00:04:28,534 --> 00:04:30,768
Okay,
what's this about, now?	|Dean GreeneDaeye	|05

99
00:04:30,834 --> 00:04:34,367
- we're greene daeye.	|GreeneDaeye Dean	|05

100
00:04:34,434 --> 00:04:35,601
- oh.	|Dean	|05

102
00:04:38,467 --> 00:04:39,667
- what do you want,
winger?

103
00:04:39,734 --> 00:04:41,067
Here to complain
about the homework

104
00:04:41,134 --> 00:04:43,801
On behalf of the class?	|Chang Jeff	|06

105
00:04:43,868 --> 00:04:45,801
- can i ask you a personal
question, senor chang?	|Jeff Chang	|06

106
00:04:45,868 --> 00:04:49,200
- okay, freud.

107
00:04:49,267 --> 00:04:52,834
Sure. you try to penetrate
my psychological armor, and--	|Chang Jeff	|06

108
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:53,967
- did your wife
leave you?	|Jeff Chang	|06

109
00:04:54,033 --> 00:04:56,534
- holy--

110
00:04:56,601 --> 00:04:58,567
How did you know?	|Chang Jeff	|06

111
00:04:58,634 --> 00:05:00,100
- well, when you
pick juries,

112
00:05:00,167 --> 00:05:02,300
You learn to read
the little stuff.

113
00:05:02,367 --> 00:05:03,667
Same shirt
twice in one week.

114
00:05:03,734 --> 00:05:06,834
teaching us the word
"esposa" means "liar."

115
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:08,534
The picture of you
with a woman

116
00:05:08,601 --> 00:05:11,234
With a post-it note
dialogue balloon above her head

117
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:14,134
That says, "enjoy it
while it lasts."	|Jeff Chang	|06

118
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:17,801
- we met at a salsa club.	|Chang Jeff	|06

119
00:05:17,868 --> 00:05:19,267
- mm.	|Jeff Chang	|06

120
00:05:19,334 --> 00:05:19,901
- and, um...

121
00:05:22,168 --> 00:05:24,834
she loved
the way i danced.

122
00:05:24,901 --> 00:05:27,767
But...i mean,
you know how it goes.

123
00:05:27,834 --> 00:05:29,268
Just--get a job...	|Chang Jeff	|06

124
00:05:29,333 --> 00:05:31,567
- stop salsa dancing.
of course i know.	|Jeff Chang	|06

125
00:05:31,634 --> 00:05:34,333
- you make no mistake
about this, winger.

126
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,001
I pleasured
that woman greatly.	|Chang Jeff	|06

127
00:05:36,067 --> 00:05:38,967
- yeah. you look like
you would have to.

128
00:05:39,034 --> 00:05:40,667
I'm not surprised
you said that.	|Jeff Chang	|06

129
00:05:46,967 --> 00:05:49,234
- i like you, winger.

130
00:05:53,367 --> 00:05:55,567
Pickled bull testicle?	|Chang Jeff	|06

131
00:05:55,634 --> 00:05:59,168
- uh, are you offering
or collecting?	|Jeff Chang	|06

133
00:06:01,067 --> 00:06:05,734
- * mary had a little lamb 

134
00:06:05,801 --> 00:06:08,400

Troy, sing.

138
00:06:16,867 --> 00:06:19,067
The assignment is to train a rat
to respond to a specific song.	|Abed Troy	|08

139
00:06:19,134 --> 00:06:20,600
- yeah, did you
have to pick a duet?

140
00:06:20,667 --> 00:06:23,101
Hmm?	|Troy Abed	|08

00:07:07,801 --> 00:07:08,667
- what about tonight?	|Chang Jeff	|09

159
00:07:09,734 --> 00:07:11,567
- absolutely.

160
00:07:11,634 --> 00:07:14,001
Oh, shoot.

161
00:07:14,067 --> 00:07:17,734
My spanish study group has to
get together every night now.

162
00:07:17,801 --> 00:07:18,967
You know,
you have been really

163
00:07:19,034 --> 00:07:20,333
Letting us have it
with this homework.	|Jeff Chang	|09

164
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:21,534
- i really have,
haven't i?	|Chang Jeff	|09

165
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:23,433
- yeah.	|Jeff Chang	|09

166
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:24,834
- tell you what.

167
00:07:24,901 --> 00:07:27,967
For my new buddy jeff,
essay canceled. sha-clackey.	|Chang Jeff	|09

168
00:07:28,034 --> 00:07:32,168
- fantastic. that is fantastic.
everybody will be so happy.	|Jeff Chang	|09

169
00:07:32,234 --> 00:07:35,101
- oh, oh,
i didn't say everybody.

170
00:07:35,168 --> 00:07:37,734
It's for
my new friend jeff.

171
00:07:37,801 --> 00:07:39,168
I mean, you're the one
coming out with me, right?	|Chang Jeff	|09

172
00:07:39,234 --> 00:07:41,201
- right. yeah.	|Jeff Chang	|09

173
00:07:41,268 --> 00:07:44,201
- i suppose it will put you
in an unenviable

174
00:07:44,268 --> 00:07:45,967
And uncomfortable
position, and want to be--	|Chang Jeff	|09

175
00:07:46,034 --> 00:07:47,234
- here's your jacket.
let's do this.	|Jeff Chang	|09

177
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:51,634
- is there a rat in here?	|Abed Chang Jeff	|10

178
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:53,901
- i have no idea
what you're talking about.	|Jeff Abed	|10

179
00:07:53,967 --> 00:07:55,168
- abed.	|Chang Abed	|10
- el tigre.	|Abed Chang	|10

180
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:06,634
- well, did you
talk to chang?	|Britta Jeff	|11

181
00:08:06,701 --> 00:08:09,767
- yeah, but it didn't
do any good.

182
00:08:09,834 --> 00:08:11,334
My head still hurts
from all the yelling.

183
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:13,601
And my pupils are
more sensitive to light

184
00:08:13,667 --> 00:08:15,133
Because he yelled
at me so much.	|Jeff Britta	|11

185
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:18,033
- oh, now i feel bad
that we made you do that.

186
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:19,101
Maybe we can help
with your essay.	|Annie Jeff	|11

187
00:08:19,167 --> 00:08:23,468
- oh, that's okay.
i'm working on mine by myself.

188
00:08:23,534 --> 00:08:25,000
You could do
my homework next time.

189
00:08:25,067 --> 00:08:27,733
See you in class.	|Jeff Annie	|11

190
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:28,734
- he's hiding something.	|Britta Annie Troy	|12

191
00:08:29,701 --> 00:08:31,667
- britta, jeff suffered for us.
give him a little credit.	|Annie Britta	|12

192
00:08:31,734 --> 00:08:33,367
- yeah. you can be
pretty cold.	|Troy Britta	|12

193
00:08:33,434 --> 00:08:34,467
- troy?	|Abed Troy	|13

194
00:08:34,534 --> 00:08:37,267
Damn. Here comes Abed.
he needs my help.

195
00:08:37,334 --> 00:08:38,234
I got to get out of here.	|Troy Abed	|13

196
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:40,600
- troy?	|Abed Troy	|13

197
00:08:40,667 --> 00:08:42,500
Have you guys seen a rat?

198
00:08:42,567 --> 00:08:45,300
Troy knocked over
fievel's cage and he escaped.	|Abed Britta Annie	|13

199
00:08:45,367 --> 00:08:47,300
- oh, abed, i'm sorry.

200
00:08:47,367 --> 00:08:49,600
He probably
found more rats

201
00:08:49,667 --> 00:08:51,434
And is very happy
living with them.	|Britta Annie	|13

202
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:54,634
- try to join the rest of us
in reality, britta.	|Abed Britta	|13

203
00:08:56,001 --> 00:08:57,500
- i believe that, uh,

204
00:08:57,567 --> 00:09:00,534
Fusing brownies
with the, uh, internet

205
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:02,534
Is going to create
the next napster

206
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:04,134
for brownies.	|Shirley	|14

207
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,801
- yawn!	|Pierce Shirley	|14

208
00:09:05,867 --> 00:09:07,600
- can't i just
write it on cards?	|Shirley Pierce	|14

209
00:09:07,667 --> 00:09:09,834
- no.

210
00:09:09,901 --> 00:09:13,068
Do you know anybody
who reads from cards?

211
00:09:13,134 --> 00:09:16,367
No, you don't,
and that's why.

212
00:09:16,434 --> 00:09:19,434
Also you might
consider a darker top.	|Pierce Shirley	|14

213
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:20,534
- note taken.	|Shirley Pierce	|14

214
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:22,734
- oh, and 

215
00:09:22,801 --> 00:09:24,200
Don't--don't, uh,
lock your knees.

216
00:09:24,267 --> 00:09:25,600
Never lock your knees.

217
00:09:25,667 --> 00:09:27,168
You know what happens
when you lock your knees?

218
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:28,634
You die.

219
00:09:28,701 --> 00:09:29,801
Second,

220
00:09:29,867 --> 00:09:31,767
When you want
to drive home a point,

221
00:09:31,834 --> 00:09:33,200
Hand them a sandwich.

222
00:09:33,267 --> 00:09:35,367
Try it.
hand them a sandwich.	|Pierce Shirley	|14

223
00:09:35,434 --> 00:09:36,801
- hand them a sandwich.	|Shirley Pierce	|14

224
00:09:36,867 --> 00:09:39,967
- yeah, except you just dropped,
uh, the sandwich,

225
00:09:40,034 --> 00:09:41,100
As opposed
to handing it to them.	|Pierce Shirley	|14

226
00:09:41,167 --> 00:09:42,801
- hand them--oh, okay.	|Shirley Pierce	|14
- right. so yeah.

227
00:09:42,868 --> 00:09:45,868
And try attention-grabbing words
to wake up the audience

228
00:09:45,967 --> 00:09:47,157
Such as, uh,
"multiple orgasm."	|Pierce Shirley	|14

229
00:09:47,234 --> 00:09:49,367
- oh, no, no,
i don't think that would

230
00:09:49,434 --> 00:09:50,767
Really fit into my message.

231
00:09:50,834 --> 00:09:53,567
Maybe we should focus,
uh, more on, um, uh...	|Shirley Pierce	|14

232
00:09:53,634 --> 00:09:55,967
- yeah, and about these
filler words of yours.

233
00:09:56,034 --> 00:09:59,034
I mean, nobody wants to buy
brownies from somebody who says,

234
00:09:59,101 --> 00:10:01,134
"um," and "like."

235
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,734
I have a method for fixing that.
start from the top.	|Pierce Shirley	|14

236
00:10:03,801 --> 00:10:05,434
- okay.

237
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:07,101
These brownies are, um--	|Shirley Pierce	|14

238
00:10:07,168 --> 00:10:08,934
- uh!	|Pierce Shirley	|14

239
00:10:09,001 --> 00:10:10,101
- they, um--	|Shirley Pierce	|14

240
00:10:10,168 --> 00:10:12,267
- uh!	|Pierce Shirley	|14

241
00:10:12,333 --> 00:10:14,233
- these brownies are...

242
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:16,267
Delicious.

243
00:10:16,333 --> 00:10:18,567
They taste like--	|Shirley Pierce	|14
- like!	|Pierce Shirley	|14

244
00:10:18,634 --> 00:10:19,767
- that's not a filler word.	|Shirley Pierce	|14

245
00:10:19,834 --> 00:10:21,434
- whatever, valley girl.	|Pierce Shirley	|14

246
00:10:23,367 --> 00:10:26,934
- the difference
between usted and tu

247
00:10:27,001 --> 00:10:28,734
Is a matter of formality.	|Chang All	|15

248
00:10:28,801 --> 00:10:32,667
pepe, usted es viejo.

249
00:10:32,734 --> 00:10:35,434
"you are old."	|Chang Pierce	|15

250
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:39,701
alberto, usted es feo.

251
00:10:39,767 --> 00:10:41,967
"you are ugly."	|Chang Abed	|15

252
00:10:42,034 --> 00:10:43,734
- no, you're not, abed.	|Shirley Abed	|15
- thanks.	|Abed Shirley	|15

253
00:10:43,801 --> 00:10:45,400
Shakira...

254
00:10:45,467 --> 00:10:46,767
Shakira...	|Chang Shirley	|15

255
00:10:46,834 --> 00:10:50,200
y tupaco...	|Chang Troy	|15

256
00:10:50,267 --> 00:10:53,701
ustedes estan sucios.

257
00:10:53,767 --> 00:10:55,901
"you are dirty."	|Chang Troy Shirley	|15

258
00:10:55,967 --> 00:10:56,967
- dirty?	|Shirley Chang	|15
- dude	|Troy Chang	|15

259
00:10:57,034 --> 00:10:58,901
- still formal,
but plural.

260
00:10:58,967 --> 00:11:01,300
Because,
while both are dirty,

261
00:11:01,367 --> 00:11:03,200
Neither are my friends.

262
00:11:03,267 --> 00:11:04,333
Okay?

263
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:05,867
And, on another subject,

264
00:11:05,934 --> 00:11:07,934
Hope you guys are working hard
on your essays.

265
00:11:08,001 --> 00:11:10,034
Because that's gonna be
30% of your grade.	|Chang All	|15

266
00:11:10,101 --> 00:11:11,233
- no.	|Annie Chang	|15
- no.	|Shirley Chang	|15

267
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:14,567
- jeff...already turned in
his essay.	|Chang All	|15

268
00:11:14,634 --> 00:11:15,567
Great job.	|Chang Jeff	|15

269
00:11:15,634 --> 00:11:17,001
- thanks.	|Jeff Chang	|15

270
00:11:17,068 --> 00:11:19,367
- as soon as you turn in
your essays on monday,

271
00:11:19,434 --> 00:11:21,300
There's gonna be
a big-ass quiz.

272
00:11:21,367 --> 00:11:23,967
So study hard.
class dismissed.	|Chang All	|15

273
00:11:26,067 --> 00:11:28,301
Ahh.	|Chang	|15

274
00:11:28,368 --> 00:11:29,400
- hey, dude.

275
00:11:29,467 --> 00:11:31,834
crazy night
last night, man.	|Chang Jeff	|16

276
00:11:31,901 --> 00:11:33,934
- hey, when you go out with me,
it gets crazy.

277
00:11:34,001 --> 00:11:36,067
That's the winger guarantee,
huh?	|Jeff Chang	|16

278
00:11:36,134 --> 00:11:38,034
- dude, let's do it again.	|Chang Jeff	|16

279
00:11:38,101 --> 00:11:39,734
- ooh, yeah, i want to.

280
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:41,567
It's just the quiz,
you know?

281
00:11:41,634 --> 00:11:43,334
Study, study.	|Jeff Chang	|16

282
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:46,001
- well, how 'bout this?

283
00:11:46,067 --> 00:11:47,301
Bling.

284
00:11:47,368 --> 00:11:48,533
A-plus.

285
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:49,967
Nice work, winger!	|Chang Jeff	|16

286
00:11:50,034 --> 00:11:52,034
- you know, i knew i could do it
if i applied myself.	|Jeff Chang	|16

288
00:11:53,301 --> 00:11:54,734
- cher--cherry daiquiri.	|Jeff Chang	|17

289
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:56,700
- cherry daiquiri!	|Chang Jeff	|17

290
00:11:56,767 --> 00:11:57,634
- daiquiri.	|Jeff Chang	|17

291
00:11:59,667 --> 00:12:01,800
- uh-huh.	|Jeff Group	|17

292
00:12:01,867 --> 00:12:03,001
- Later.	|Chang Jeff	|17

293
00:12:03,067 --> 00:12:04,433
- you devious clump

294
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:06,268
Of overpriced fabric
and hair product.	|Annie Jeff	|18

295
00:12:06,334 --> 00:12:07,634
- speaking
as one of the meek,

296
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:09,234
As soon as i inherit
the earth, you a dead man.	|Shirley Jeff	|18

297
00:12:09,301 --> 00:12:11,634
- you got a weird forehead.	|Troy Jeff	|18

298
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:13,167
- we're all
very disappointed.	|Britta Jeff	|18

299
00:12:13,234 --> 00:12:14,767
- all right, dial it back
a little, britta.	|Pierce Britta	|18

300
00:12:14,834 --> 00:12:16,533
- if anyone should
be disappointed, it's me.

301
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:18,867
What kind of a group
threatens to kick someone out

302
00:12:18,934 --> 00:12:20,301
Unless he helps them?	|Jeff Group	|18

303
00:12:20,368 --> 00:12:22,433
- what kind of a person
is asked to help other people

304
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:23,600
And then helps himself!	|Pierce Jeff	|18

305
00:12:23,667 --> 00:12:24,533
- yeah.	|Annie	|18
- mm-hmm.	|Britta	|18

306
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:26,167
- helps himself?

307
00:12:26,234 --> 00:12:28,167
I don't think i like
being talked to that way!	|Jeff Group	|18

308
00:12:28,234 --> 00:12:31,334
- he's using fake outrage
to justify leaving.	|Britta Group	|18

309
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:33,634
- fake outrage?
justify my--

310
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:35,334
Yeah, that's it.
i'm out of here.	|Jeff Britta	|18

311
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:37,700
- oh, you're breaking up
with the group?	|Annie Jeff	|18

312
00:12:37,767 --> 00:12:39,400
- that's what you guys want.	|Jeff Group	|18

313
00:12:39,467 --> 00:12:41,533
- it's all right,
i've been divorced seven times.

314
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:42,800
Don't answer your phones

315
00:12:42,867 --> 00:12:45,167
And bury all your money
in the backyard.	|Pierce Group	|18

316
00:12:45,234 --> 00:12:45,834
- here you go.

317
00:12:45,901 --> 00:12:47,467
Look at pierce's paragraph
from unit two.	|Chang Jeff	|19

318
00:12:47,533 --> 00:12:52,400
- let's see. "I took a computer class..."

319
00:12:52,467 --> 00:12:53,600
The apple store.

320
00:12:53,667 --> 00:12:54,967
Adorable.	|Jeff Chang	|19
- keep going, keep going.	|Chang Jeff	|19

321
00:12:55,034 --> 00:12:59,734
- and the saleswoman
had manzanas gigante.

322
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:01,001
Ruined it.	|Jeff Chang	|19

323
00:13:01,067 --> 00:13:02,500
- can you imagine
being married to him?	|Chang Jeff	|19

324
00:13:02,567 --> 00:13:03,901
- seven times!

325
00:13:03,967 --> 00:13:07,001
Seven different women
agreed to marry that guy.

326
00:13:07,067 --> 00:13:08,400
- it's cra--	|Jeff Chang	|19

00:13:13,201 --> 00:13:14,600
I'm so alone.

329
00:13:14,667 --> 00:13:16,867
I'm so lonely!

330
00:13:16,934 --> 00:13:17,467
I want to die.	|Chang Jeff	|19

331
00:13:17,533 --> 00:13:19,734
- come on man, it--
come on, don't do that.	|Jeff Chang	|19

333
00:13:22,467 --> 00:13:24,201
I...

334
00:13:24,268 --> 00:13:26,667
Just miss her so much.	|Chang Jeff	|19
- yeah.	|Jeff Chang	|19

335
00:13:26,734 --> 00:13:28,334
- i'm sorry.

336
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:30,634
This is so stupid.	|Chang Jeff	|19
- no, no, it's fine.

337
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:32,067
It's just--buddy,
you know...	|Jeff Chang	|19

338
00:13:32,134 --> 00:13:35,567
- it's dumb!	|Chang Jeff	|19
- i can see that you're hurting.

339
00:13:35,634 --> 00:13:37,001
Um, but i have to get
to accounting.

340
00:13:37,067 --> 00:13:38,301
And it's not like i'm hitting
strip clubs

341
00:13:38,368 --> 00:13:39,467
With professor whitman.	|Jeff Chang	|19

342
00:13:39,533 --> 00:13:41,800
- you better not be!	|Chang Jeff	|19
- what?	|Jeff Chang	|19

343
00:13:41,867 --> 00:13:43,901
- all i ask

344
00:13:43,967 --> 00:13:46,467
Is for you to keep
filling the void in my soul.	|Chang Jeff	|19

345
00:13:46,533 --> 00:13:49,001
- well, i'll have
to think of something.

346
00:13:49,002 --> 00:13:52,002
Let me rest gently on your pecs.	|Jeff Chang	|19

347
00:13:54,234 --> 00:13:56,401
- best closer to a presentation,
a nicholson quote.

348
00:13:56,467 --> 00:13:59,234
Uh, you take a phrase
from one of his films

349
00:13:59,301 --> 00:14:00,700
And you tailor it
to your product.

350
00:14:00,767 --> 00:14:02,834
You can't handle
a moist towelette!

351
00:14:03,101 --> 00:14:04,534
Something like that,
you know?

352
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:06,800
But you can't use that one.
that's--that's mine.	|Pierce Shirley	|20

353
00:14:06,867 --> 00:14:08,201
- thanks, pierce.	|Shirley Pierce	|20
- sure.	|Pierce Shirley	|20

354
00:14:08,267 --> 00:14:10,000
- i'm just gonna
write it on some cards.	|Shirley Pierce	|20

355
00:14:10,067 --> 00:14:11,367
- okay.

356
00:14:11,434 --> 00:14:15,468
Just don't let anybody know
i was involved.	|Pierce Shirley	|20

357
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
- why do you care so much?	|Troy Abed	|21

358
00:14:31,067 --> 00:14:32,234
- i don't.	|Pierce Troy	|21

359
00:14:32,301 --> 00:14:33,501
- because fievel's
going to die.	|Abed Troy	|21

360
00:14:33,568 --> 00:14:35,568
- i'd rather die than listen.	|Pierce Abed	|21

361
00:14:35,633 --> 00:14:37,000
- who's going to die?	|Annie Abed	|21
- yeah.	|Shirley Abed	|21

362
00:14:37,067 --> 00:14:38,234
- the dean says
the exterminator is coming

363
00:14:38,301 --> 00:14:39,600
Because of our rat.	|Abed Shirley Annie	|21

364
00:14:39,667 --> 00:14:41,900
- i'd like to exterminate
this conversation.	|Pierce Abed	|21

365
00:14:41,967 --> 00:14:43,434
- what are you doing?	|Britta Pierce	|21

366
00:14:43,501 --> 00:14:44,501
- he's sitting
in jeff's chair,

367
00:14:44,568 --> 00:14:45,434
So he's trying
to act like jeff.	|Abed Britta	|21

368
00:14:45,501 --> 00:14:47,568

- oh, an email.	|Pierce	|21

371
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:52,400
- i thought you might
want to help me out

372
00:14:52,467 --> 00:14:54,001
Because we are friends.	|Abed Troy	|21

373
00:14:54,068 --> 00:14:55,801
- abed, take it from
a former prom king.

374
00:14:55,867 --> 00:14:58,567
real friends
help me with things.

375
00:14:58,634 --> 00:14:59,701
Not vice versa.	|Troy Abed	|21

376
00:14:59,767 --> 00:15:01,634
- i would face my fears
to help you.	|Abed Troy	|21

377
00:15:01,701 --> 00:15:04,567
- exactly!
'cause you're my friend.	|Troy Abed	|21

- * beneath the pale... *	|Abed Troy	|21

383
00:15:13,901 --> 00:15:14,568
- he gets any nuttier,

384
00:15:14,633 --> 00:15:15,468
they're gonna
put him on the view.	|Pierce Group	|21

386
00:15:17,234 --> 00:15:18,501
- that works, yeah.	|Troy Pierce	|21

387
00:15:18,568 --> 00:15:20,633
- what are we gonna do?

okay, thank you.

395
00:15:33,501 --> 00:15:35,700
Green week
was a rousing success

396
00:15:35,767 --> 00:15:38,501
Here at greendale.

397
00:15:38,568 --> 00:15:40,568
And now for our band,
greene daeye!

398
00:15:40,633 --> 00:15:41,934
By the way, they're not
the real green day.

399
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,034
Thought we should just
rip that band-aid off quickly.

400
00:15:44,101 --> 00:15:45,867
Okay!	|Dean All	|23

Wanna hang out?

406
00:15:55,267 --> 00:15:58,633
- actually, i had an idea
for an extra credit project.	|Jeff Chang	|23

407
00:15:58,700 --> 00:15:59,967
- we've been asked

408

To dedicate
our first song

409
00:16:02,633 --> 00:16:06,367
To senor and senora chang.	|GreeneDaeye All	|23

want to talk to me.	|Chang Jeff	|23

412
00:16:12,434 --> 00:16:14,934

you wanted to talk.	|Jeff Chang	|23

413
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,301

That you throw at us
