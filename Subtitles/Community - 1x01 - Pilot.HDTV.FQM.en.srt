1
00:00:14,275 --> 00:00:15,446
Good morning.

2
00:00:17,449 --> 00:00:21,039
How do we turn this off? Mother, you think
you can come and help me turn it off?

3
00:00:22,003 --> 00:00:24,274
How do we turn this off?
Can you help me with this?

4
00:00:24,275 --> 00:00:26,765
Oh, thank you, thank you so much.
I didn't mean to snap.

5
00:00:26,767 --> 00:00:28,767
- uh, good morning.

6
00:00:28,834 --> 00:00:30,834
Many of you
are halfway through

7
00:00:30,901 --> 00:00:32,601
Your first week here
at greendale

8
00:00:32,667 --> 00:00:35,968
And as your dean,
i thought i would

9
00:00:36,033 --> 00:00:39,501
Share a few thoughts
of wisdom and inspiration.

10
00:00:39,567 --> 00:00:41,334
What is community college?

11
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:44,134
Well, you've heard
all kinds of things.

12
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:46,933
You've heard it's
"loser college

13
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,034
For remedial teens,
20-something dropouts,

14
00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:52,351
Middle-age divorcees,

15
00:00:52,718 --> 00:00:54,651
And old people keeping
their minds active

16
00:00:54,718 --> 00:00:57,517
As they circle
the drain of eternity."

17
00:00:57,584 --> 00:00:59,718
That's what you heard.

18
00:00:59,783 --> 00:01:02,551
However, i wish you luck!

19
00:01:06,517 --> 00:01:09,084
Okay, you know--
uh-oh.

20
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:10,551
Okay, there's more
to this speech.

21
00:01:10,618 --> 00:01:11,718
There's actually a middle card
that is missing.

22
00:01:11,783 --> 00:01:13,783
Can we all look around our
immediate areas,

23
00:01:13,850 --> 00:01:15,351
'cause i really wanted to--	|Dean

24
00:01:15,417 --> 00:01:16,218
- i'm only half-arabic,
actually.

25
00:01:16,284 --> 00:01:17,884
My dad is palestinian.
he's a u.s. citizen.

26
00:01:17,951 --> 00:01:19,450
He's not a threat to national
security or anything.

27
00:01:19,517 --> 00:01:20,717
A lot of people want to know
that after they meet him,

28
00:01:20,784 --> 00:01:21,851
Because he has
an angry energy.

29
00:01:21,917 --> 00:01:22,917
But not, like,
angry at america.

30
00:01:22,984 --> 00:01:24,284
Just angry at my mom
for leaving him.

31
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:25,584
Although she did leave
because he was angry

32
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:27,117
And he was angry
because she's american.

33
00:01:27,184 --> 00:01:28,884
My name's abed,
by the way.	|Abed Jeff

34
00:01:28,951 --> 00:01:32,151
- abed, nice to know you and
then meet you in that order.

35
00:01:32,218 --> 00:01:33,851
Now about that question
that i had--	|Jeff Abed

36
00:01:33,917 --> 00:01:35,318
- oh, uh...

37
00:01:35,383 --> 00:01:37,051
5 after 11:00
when you asked.	|Abed Jeff

38
00:01:37,117 --> 00:01:38,450
- abed?	|Jeff Abed
- yeah?	|Abed Jeff

39
00:01:38,517 --> 00:01:40,750
- what's the deal with
the hot girl from spanish class?

40
00:01:40,817 --> 00:01:42,584
I can't find a road
in there.	|Jeff Abed

41
00:01:42,650 --> 00:01:43,951
- well, i only talked
to her once

42
00:01:44,017 --> 00:01:45,984
While she was borrowing
a pencil, but...

43
00:01:46,051 --> 00:01:47,750
Her name is britta, she's 28,
birthday in october,

44
00:01:47,817 --> 00:01:48,984
She has two older brothers
and one of 'em

45
00:01:49,051 --> 00:01:50,084
Works with children
who have a disorder

46
00:01:50,151 --> 00:01:51,251
I might want to look up.

47
00:01:51,318 --> 00:01:52,483
Oh, and she thinks
she's gonna flunk

48
00:01:52,550 --> 00:01:53,750
Tomorrow's test,
so she really needs to focus

49
00:01:53,817 --> 00:01:56,251
So she's sorry
if that makes her seem cold.	|Abed Jeff

50
00:01:56,318 --> 00:01:57,483
- holy crap.

51
00:01:57,550 --> 00:01:58,211
Abed...

52
00:01:58,718 --> 00:02:01,784
I see your value now.	|Jeff Abed

53
00:02:02,351 --> 00:02:04,517
- that's the nicest thing
anyone's ever said to me.	|Abed Jeff

54
00:02:07,356 --> 00:02:08,706
Absolutely not.	|Duncan

55
00:02:10,035 --> 00:02:13,429
If these guys knew you like I did
they would have given you a small office.	|Jeff Duncan

56
00:02:13,584 --> 00:02:14,817
- jeff winger!

57
00:02:14,884 --> 00:02:16,684
Genius at law.	|Duncan Jeff

58
00:02:16,751 --> 00:02:20,284
- you got to stop saying that.	|Jeff Duncan
- i will never do that. sit down

59
00:02:20,285 --> 00:02:22,885
I still cannot figure out how you
gonna join

60
00:02:22,886 --> 00:02:24,936
September the 11th with my DUI,

61
00:02:24,937 --> 00:02:26,737
that alone, why that helped.	|Duncan Jeff

62
00:02:26,738 --> 00:02:29,038
Well, 2002 was a simple time.	|Jeff Duncan

63
00:02:29,025 --> 00:02:31,316
So what is my lawyer
doing here?	|Duncan Jeff

64
00:02:31,845 --> 00:02:33,245
- i'm a student.	|Jeff Duncan

65
00:02:33,729 --> 00:02:36,430
- well, that cannot be
an inspiring journey.	|Duncan Jeff

66
00:02:36,431 --> 00:02:38,403
- uh, i am in a bit
of a jam.	|Jeff Duncan

67
00:02:38,404 --> 00:02:41,205
The state bar has
suspended my license.	|Jeff Ducnan

68
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:44,875
They found out my college degree
Was less than legitimate.	|Jeff Duncan

69
00:02:44,876 --> 00:02:46,793
- i thought you had a bachelor's
from columbia.	|Duncan Jeff

70
00:02:46,794 --> 00:02:49,087
- now i have to get one
from america.	|Jeff Duncan

71
00:02:49,088 --> 00:02:51,061
- and it can't be
an email attachment.	|Jeff Duncan

72
00:02:51,062 --> 00:02:52,833
- well, you've picked
a fine school.	|Duncan Jeff

73
00:02:52,834 --> 00:02:56,140
- yes, and i'm hoping
that our friendship

74
00:02:56,266 --> 00:02:57,861
Will yield certain advantages.

75
00:02:57,862 --> 00:02:59,484
You know, academic guidance...	|Jeff Duncan
- yes.	|Duncan Jeff

76
00:02:59,485 --> 00:03:00,872
- moral support,

77
00:03:00,873 --> 00:03:03,600
Every answer
to every test

78
00:03:03,749 --> 00:03:05,678
For every one of the classes
that i'm taking.

79
00:03:05,713 --> 00:03:08,243
Here's my schedule.	|Jeff Duncan
- no. Now, jeff, just by asking that,

80
00:03:08,244 --> 00:03:12,001
You have insulted the integrity
of this entire institution.	|Duncan Jeff

81
00:03:12,921 --> 00:03:14,638
Waster!
not a bathroom!

82
00:03:14,639 --> 00:03:17,281
Not a bathroom.	|Duncan
- okay. Duncan, you...

83
00:03:17,282 --> 00:03:20,727
did seem less into integrity
The day that i convinced

84
00:03:20,728 --> 00:03:24,487
12 of yours peers that when you made
that u-turn on the freeway

85
00:03:24,488 --> 00:03:27,345
And tried to order chalupas
from the emergency call box,

86
00:03:27,346 --> 00:03:29,283
That your only real crime
was loving america.	|Jeff Duncan

87
00:03:29,284 --> 00:03:32,054
Well, I do love America, I do love it,
very much.

88
00:03:33,276 --> 00:03:35,382
I love chalupas.

89
00:03:35,577 --> 00:03:36,742
But...

90
00:03:36,916 --> 00:03:38,538
- i'll look into it. 	|Duncan Jeff
- thank you.

91
00:03:38,539 --> 00:03:40,787
Duncan, you are a good man.	|Jeff Duncan

92
00:03:41,186 --> 00:03:45,032
- jeff, are you familiar with the adage,
"cheaters never prosper"?	|Duncan Jeff

93
00:03:45,033 --> 00:03:46,110
No...

94
00:03:46,111 --> 00:03:49,400
and if i wanted to learn something,
I wouldn't have come to community college.	|Jeff Duncan


96
00:03:57,358 --> 00:04:00,837


97
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:03,451


98
00:04:22,431 --> 00:04:25,531
- oh, hey! spanish.	|Jeff Britta
- uh, don't hit on me, okay?	|Britta Jeff

99
00:04:25,747 --> 00:04:27,938
- whoa. 
I wouldn't dream of it.

100
00:04:27,939 --> 00:04:31,233
I just wanted to let you know
about my spanish study group.	|Jeff Britta

101
00:04:33,342 --> 00:04:37,310
the guy who's playing bejeweled
on his iphone all class has a study group?

102
00:04:37,311 --> 00:04:38,819
Um, can i sign up twice?	|Britta Jeff

103
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:42,707
- i'm taking the class as an easy credit.
I'm actually a spanish tutor.	|Jeff Britta

104
00:04:42,708 --> 00:04:45,522
- Board certified.	|Jeff Britta
- can you say that in spanish now?	|Britta Jeff

105
00:04:45,847 --> 00:04:50,331

106
00:04:52,607 --> 00:04:56,107
- i really need help with spanish.	|Britta Jeff
- yeah, i was willing to bet.. i'm jeff.

107
00:04:56,108 --> 00:04:57,108
Or "Jefe".

109
00:04:57,976 --> 00:05:00,956
- We meet at the library at 4:00.	|Jeff Britta
- yeah, britta. thanks.	|Britta Jeff

110
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:04,445
You gonna be there?

111
00:05:05,939 --> 00:05:07,189
Un po' di piu'.

112
00:05:07,342 --> 00:05:09,192
That means "See you there".	|Jeff Britta

113
00:05:10,268 --> 00:05:13,042
Shouldn't be too hard to fake
a study group, right?

114
00:05:13,609 --> 00:05:15,715
Oh, geez, I'm sorry... I...

115
00:05:15,908 --> 00:05:19,227
I was raised on TV and I was conditioned
to believe that every...

116
00:05:19,228 --> 00:05:22,128
Black woman over 50 is a cosmic mentor..	|Jeff Extra

117
00:05:22,389 --> 00:05:25,818
Were you conditioned to pay
for your damn taco, Sanfield?	|Extra Jeff

118
00:05:25,819 --> 00:05:27,719
Yes, I'm so sorry.

119
00:05:27,978 --> 00:05:29,209
It's Seinfeld.	|Jeff Extra

121
00:05:34,738 --> 00:05:35,984
Bienvenido.	|Jeff

122
00:05:36,446 --> 00:05:37,840
Bienvenuto!

123
00:05:38,072 --> 00:05:39,559
Hey, all right,
come on in. 

124
00:05:40,187 --> 00:05:42,427
- I got the whole table. Welcome.	|Jeff Britta
- Yeah.

125
00:05:42,428 --> 00:05:44,704
- We have the whole room.	|Britta Jeff
- Yeah, here's the, uh...

126
00:05:45,901 --> 00:05:48,111
contact sheet.
Just put your stuff there.

127
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:50,526
Man.

128
00:05:51,445 --> 00:05:53,308
Rest of the group
is running late.

129
00:05:53,309 --> 00:05:55,088
But you and i can
get acquainted.	|Jeff Britta


130
00:05:55,089 --> 00:05:57,916
- you may have noticed this morning,
Not so good at the small talk.	|Britta Jeff

131
00:05:57,917 --> 00:05:59,623
- yeah, i like big talk.
what's your deal?	|Jeff Britta

132
00:05:59,624 --> 00:06:02,786
- that's not small talk?	|Britta Jeff
- what's your deal and is god dead?	|Jeff Britta

133
00:06:03,311 --> 00:06:04,982
- all right, you want
to know my deal?

134
00:06:04,983 --> 00:06:07,700
I dropped out of high-school because

135
00:06:07,735 --> 00:06:09,297
I thought for some reason 
it would impress Radiohead.	|Britta Jeff

136
00:06:09,298 --> 00:06:11,615
You'd be surprised what gets back
to these guys.	|Jeff Britta

137
00:06:11,774 --> 00:06:14,024
I joined the peace corp.

138
00:06:14,146 --> 00:06:15,695
I did a little foot modelling,

139
00:06:15,696 --> 00:06:17,869
I got tear gased in a World Trade Rally...	|Britta Jeff

140
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:19,089
Marry me.	|Jeff Britta

141
00:06:19,090 --> 00:06:22,882
And I think, Jeff, my deal is above all else,
honesty.	|Britta Jeff


142
00:06:23,774 --> 00:06:25,279
- honesty?	|Jeff Britta
- yeah.

143
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:27,052
You tell me the truth,
i will like you.

144
00:06:27,053 --> 00:06:29,649
You lie to me, i will never talk to you again.
That's my deal.	|Britta Jeff

145
00:06:29,857 --> 00:06:31,959
- ah, that's a good deal.	|Jeff Britta
- So what's your deal?	|Britta Jeff

146
00:06:32,807 --> 00:06:36,094
- uh, i would have to go--
I would have to say,

147
00:06:36,664 --> 00:06:37,820
um, honesty,

148
00:06:38,008 --> 00:06:39,131
Because...

149
00:06:39,288 --> 00:06:42,434
I would say anything
to get what i want.

150
00:06:42,435 --> 00:06:44,414
And i want you
to like me. So, uh..	|Jeff Britta
 

151
00:06:45,550 --> 00:06:47,750
- wow.
that's a very honest answer.

152
00:06:48,214 --> 00:06:50,014
All right,

153
00:06:50,098 --> 00:06:52,927
- really? Wow. you're easy.	|Jeff Britta
- hell yeah.	|Britta Jeff

154
00:06:53,322 --> 00:06:55,564
Abed in the house!	|Britta Abed

155
00:06:58,418 --> 00:07:00,808
- why?	|Jeff Abed
- britta invited me. is that cool?	|Abed Jeff

156
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,805
- oh, i can't think
of a single logical reason why not.	|Jeff Abed

157
00:07:03,806 --> 00:07:05,842
- cool.	|Abed Jeff
- there you go.

158
00:07:05,877 --> 00:07:08,212
Oh, hey, here. Put your contact info down
right there.

159
00:07:08,213 --> 00:07:10,680
That's right.	|Jeff Abed
- cool, cool, cool.

160
00:07:10,715 --> 00:07:12,217
Cool, cool, cool.

161
00:07:13,507 --> 00:07:15,237
hey, this is kind of like
breakfast club, huh?	|Abed Jeff Britta

162
00:07:15,238 --> 00:07:16,868
- we are in a library.	|Britta Abed
- yeah.

163
00:07:16,869 --> 00:07:19,818
i'm sure we've each got an issue balled up inside of us 
that would make us cry if we talked about it.	|Abed Jeff Britta

164
00:07:19,819 --> 00:07:22,393
- do you have something
balled up inside of you?	|Britta Abed

165
00:07:22,762 --> 00:07:25,338
- well, i got a little doozy
in the chamber if things get emotional.	|Abed Jeff

166
00:07:28,082 --> 00:07:29,417
Oh.
hey, text message.

167
00:07:29,786 --> 00:07:32,204
- Let's give this bad boy a read.	|Abed Jeff Britta
- it's probably just for your eyes.	|Jeff Abed

168
00:07:32,205 --> 00:07:34,963
- I've never got one of these	|Abed Jeff Britta
- Well, it's jut.. You probably... 

169
00:07:34,964 --> 00:07:37,953
- it's probably just for your eyes.	|Jeff Abed
- "say you have to pee. i need to talk to you."	|Abed Jeff Britta

170
00:07:39,375 --> 00:07:40,889
"say you have to pee."	|Abed Britta

171
00:07:40,890 --> 00:07:42,158
- that is weird.	|Britta Abed

172
00:07:42,159 --> 00:07:44,540
- "say you have to pee. I need to talk to you."	|Abed Jeff
- do you have to pee?	|Jeff Abed

173
00:07:44,541 --> 00:07:47,147
- no.	|Abed Jeff
- hmm.	|Jeff Abed

174
00:07:47,148 --> 00:07:49,051
- that's so weird.	|Abed Jeff
- well, i'm stumped. That's very creepy.

176
00:07:50,017 --> 00:07:51,996
That's very creepy.	|Jeff Abed
- does it say you have to pee?	|Abed Jeff

177
00:07:51,997 --> 00:07:53,766
- no, it's just someone

178
00:07:53,767 --> 00:07:56,206
With a misguided grasp
of abbreviation.	|Jeff Abed

179
00:07:56,384 --> 00:07:59,402
I just need five minutes, you guys,
So go ahead and study

180
00:07:59,581 --> 00:08:01,345
all the verbs...in spanish.	|Jeff Abed Britta

181
00:08:01,984 --> 00:08:03,176
- Abed...	|Britta Abed
- Yeah?	|Abed Britta

182
00:08:03,177 --> 00:08:04,537
What's your read on that guy?	|Britta Abed

183
00:08:05,725 --> 00:08:07,325
You look like Elisabeth Shue.	|Abed Britta

184
00:08:09,666 --> 00:08:13,342
Act natural, pretend you are watching
the athletic proceedings.	|Duncan Jeff

185
00:08:13,343 --> 00:08:15,320
I couldn't stop watching them.

186
00:08:15,321 --> 00:08:19,313
There's a guy going for the track, that's older
than the game of poker.

187
00:08:20,432 --> 00:08:21,932
He's kinda cracking.	|Jeff Duncan

188
00:08:22,416 --> 00:08:26,456
- suppose i was to say to you
It was possible to get those test answers?	|Duncan Jeff

189
00:08:26,457 --> 00:08:29,297
- i would say, "go for that,"
And could have said so in a text.	|Jeff Duncan

190
00:08:29,298 --> 00:08:32,470
- i'm asking you if you know the difference
Between right and wrong.	|Duncan Jeff

191
00:08:33,222 --> 00:08:36,085
- i discovered at a very early age
That if i talk long enough,

192
00:08:36,086 --> 00:08:38,163
I could make anything
right or wrong.

193
00:08:38,164 --> 00:08:41,041
So either i'm god
or truth is relative.

194
00:08:41,076 --> 00:08:42,776
And in either case,
booyah.	|Jeff Duncan

195
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:46,194
- oh, interesting. It's just the average person has
a much harder time saying,

196
00:08:46,195 --> 00:08:48,105
"booyah,"
to moral relativism.	|Duncan Jeff

197
00:08:48,106 --> 00:08:50,667
- duncan, you don't have to play shrink 
To protect your pride.

198
00:08:50,668 --> 00:08:52,423
I accept.
you're chicken.	|Jeff Duncan

199
00:08:52,424 --> 00:08:54,907
Are you trying to use reverse psychology
on a psychologist?	|Duncan Jeff

200
00:08:54,908 --> 00:08:58,187
No, I'm just using regular psychology
on a spineless, British twit.	|Jeff Duncan

201
00:08:58,188 --> 00:09:00,115
- i'm a professor.
you can't talk to me that way.	|Duncan Jeff

202
00:09:00,116 --> 00:09:03,417
- a six-year-old girl could talk to you that way.	|Jeff Duncan
- yes, because that would be adorable!	|Duncan Jeff

203
00:09:03,452 --> 00:09:06,840
- No, because you're a five-year-old girl
And there's a pecking order.	|Jeff Duncan

204
00:09:06,841 --> 00:09:08,757
- fine! i'll do it!	|Duncan Jeff
- thank you.	|Jeff Duncan

205
00:09:08,758 --> 00:09:10,458
- yeah, pleasure.

206
00:09:10,586 --> 00:09:11,586
Bye!

207
00:09:11,734 --> 00:09:13,108
Yes!
good!

208
00:09:13,436 --> 00:09:15,337
Why am i still shouting?

209
00:09:15,338 --> 00:09:16,910
I'm drawing attention
to myself.	|Duncan Jeff

210
00:09:17,090 --> 00:09:20,195
- you guys aren't gonna believe this,
But the rest of the group...

211
00:09:21,411 --> 00:09:22,556
Is here.	|Jeff Britta Abed

212
00:09:22,728 --> 00:09:25,158
- are you
the board-certified tutor?	|Pierce Jeff

213
00:09:25,159 --> 00:09:26,953
- that means you do my homework,
right, Seacrest?	|Troy Jeff

214
00:09:26,954 --> 00:09:29,020
- i need to call my babysitter
If we're gon' be later than 10:00.	|Shirley Jeff

215
00:09:29,021 --> 00:09:30,799
- what board certifies
a tutor?	|Annie Jeff

216
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,017
- where's britta?	|Jeff Abed
- not sure.

217
00:09:32,018 --> 00:09:34,530
But i invited more people
from spanish class. Is that cool? 	|Abed Jeff

218
00:09:34,531 --> 00:09:36,228
- it's the coolest.	|Jeff Abed

219
00:09:36,970 --> 00:09:39,788
I'm gonna go
to the bathroom

220
00:09:39,823 --> 00:09:42,290
And bring my jacket,

221
00:09:42,325 --> 00:09:44,733
wallet,
and keys with me


222
00:09:45,056 --> 00:09:46,506
In case there's a fire.	|Jeff Group

223
00:09:47,334 --> 00:09:48,471
- should we go with him?	|Shirley Group

224
00:09:48,472 --> 00:09:50,423
- i'm leaving my homework with
slumdog millionaire over here.	|Troy Group

225
00:09:50,424 --> 00:09:52,374
- that's borderline racist,
i think.	|Shirley Troy

226
00:09:56,351 --> 00:09:58,029
- and busted.	|Britta Jeff

227
00:09:58,746 --> 00:10:01,425
- uh, listen.	|Jeff Britta
- now you know. I'm a smoker.	|Britta Jeff

228
00:10:02,611 --> 00:10:05,099
- yeah, but they're filtered,
so that makes them safe.	|Jeff Britta

229
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:08,224
- you ready to get started?
Looks like the rest of your group showed up.	|Britta Jeff

230
00:10:08,225 --> 00:10:11,553
- yeah, not mine, actually.
I think abed took out a page on craigslist.

231
00:10:11,554 --> 00:10:13,431
And i was trained never
to say this,

232
00:10:13,432 --> 00:10:16,075
But i think that group
may be untutorable.	|Jeff Britta


233
00:10:16,110 --> 00:10:17,210
- oh, really?	|Britta Jeff

234
00:10:17,324 --> 00:10:19,719
- so why don't you and i
go study over--	|Jeff Britta

235
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:21,423
- dinner?	|Britta Jeff
- or drinks.	|Jeff Britta

236
00:10:21,424 --> 00:10:23,959
- i think, actually,
we should prioritize here

237
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:26,379
And study first
and then go to dinner.

238
00:10:28,022 --> 00:10:31,839
And if they really prove
to be untutorable, we'll slip out early.	|Britta Jeff

239
00:10:33,945 --> 00:10:35,095
- oh...they will be...

240
00:10:35,643 --> 00:10:36,793
untutorable.	|Jeff

241
00:10:43,189 --> 00:10:45,267
- all right.

242
00:10:45,542 --> 00:10:47,063
Look at this crew.

243
00:10:47,098 --> 00:10:49,815
All ready to study all night.	|Jeff Group

244
00:10:49,850 --> 00:10:51,142
- well, i can stay
at least till 10:00.	|Shirley Group

245
00:10:51,143 --> 00:10:53,618
- but who studies
with strangers, right?

246
00:10:53,896 --> 00:10:55,146
My name is jeff.	|Jeff Group

247
00:10:55,395 --> 00:10:56,635
- jeff, it's a pleasure.

248
00:10:56,765 --> 00:10:58,600
My name is pierce hawthorne
and, yes,

249
00:10:58,601 --> 00:11:02,047
That is hawthorne as in hawthorne wipes,
The award-winning moist towellete.	|Pierce Jeff

250
00:11:02,326 --> 00:11:03,399
- i was just going to ask.	|Jeff Pierce

251
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:05,982
- i'm also a toast master, so perhaps
I should do the introductions.	|Pierce Group


252
00:11:05,983 --> 00:11:07,614
- definitely!	|Jeff Pierce
- all right, you already know brittles.	|Pierce Jeff

253
00:11:07,615 --> 00:11:09,919
- britta.	|Britta Pierce
- abed. Abed the arab.

254
00:11:09,954 --> 00:11:11,267
Is that inappropriate?	|Pierce Jeff
- sure.	|Abed Pierce

255
00:11:11,268 --> 00:11:13,381
- roy. roy the wonder boy.	|Pierce Jeff
- "Troy".	|Troy Pierce

256
00:11:13,416 --> 00:11:15,457
- little princess elizabeth.	|Pierce Jeff
- "Annie".	|Annie Pierce

257
00:11:15,727 --> 00:11:18,803
- and finally, this beautiful
creature is named shirley.	|Pierce Jeff

258
00:11:19,496 --> 00:11:20,712
- is that even close?	|Jeff Shirley

259
00:11:21,410 --> 00:11:23,758
- i'd like to know why i had to find out
About this group on accident?	|Annie Group

260
00:11:23,759 --> 00:11:26,143
- - this is getting way more like breakfast club now.	|Abed Group
- there's breakfast?	|Pierce Abed

261
00:11:26,144 --> 00:11:27,571
- okay, um, maybe we should
get started--	|Britta Group

262
00:11:27,572 --> 00:11:30,140
- you know, i've been a part
of a lot of study groups that fell apart

263
00:11:30,141 --> 00:11:32,141
because
of unresolved tension.

264
00:11:32,309 --> 00:11:35,061
Shouldn't we address Annie's concern? 
Did we not invite her?	|Jeff Group

265
00:11:35,062 --> 00:11:36,832
- well, annie, sweetie,
it's not behind your back.

266
00:11:36,833 --> 00:11:39,884
- We just didn't think about...	|Shirley Jeff
- can we stop with the "pumpkins" and the "sweeties"?

267
00:11:40,137 --> 00:11:42,073
Being younger does
not make me inferior.

268
00:11:42,074 --> 00:11:45,621
If anything, your age indicates
That you've made bad life decisions.	|Annie Shirley

269
00:11:45,794 --> 00:11:47,782
- shirley has a response to that.	|Jeff Shirley
- no, no, no. i don't.	|Shirley Jeff

270
00:11:47,783 --> 00:11:50,589
- you should. it looks like you do.	|Troy Shirley
- please, shirley.	|Jeff Shirley

271
00:11:50,590 --> 00:11:52,246
- okay, okay.

272
00:11:52,387 --> 00:11:55,472
I'm sure i've made
some bad life decisions

273
00:11:55,628 --> 00:11:58,299
And maybe annie's decisions
will be better.

274
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:01,870
But i think she needs to decide
Whether she wants to be considered a child

275
00:12:01,950 --> 00:12:04,271
Or an adult, because children get pity

276
00:12:04,272 --> 00:12:06,998
But not respect. And adults, 
they get respect,

277
00:12:06,999 --> 00:12:09,636
But they also get the back of they head grabbed 
And their face pushed through jukeboxes.	|Shirley Annie

278
00:12:09,637 --> 00:12:10,741
- okay.

279
00:12:10,776 --> 00:12:14,080
Why don't we try learning
"jukebox" in spanish?	|Britta Group

280
00:12:14,081 --> 00:12:16,081
- what are you doing?	|Shirley Pierce
- pierce!

281
00:12:16,082 --> 00:12:18,161
- Let's discuss this creepiness.	|Jeff Pierce
- pardon you?	|Pierce Jeff

282
00:12:18,162 --> 00:12:20,089
- what are you doing?	|Britta Jeff
- i'm certified.	|Jeff Britta

283
00:12:20,261 --> 00:12:24,014
Are you unaware that shirley
Finds your advances inappropriate?	|Jeff Pierce

284
00:12:25,268 --> 00:12:26,356
what advances?	|Pierce Jeff

285
00:12:26,357 --> 00:12:29,665
- you have been sexually harassing me
Since the very first day of class.	|Shirley Pierce

286
00:12:29,666 --> 00:12:31,316
- sexually harassing?

287
00:12:31,981 --> 00:12:33,960
what? That makes no sense to me.

288
00:12:33,995 --> 00:12:37,114
Why would i harass somebody
who turns me on?	|Pierce Shirley

289
00:12:37,115 --> 00:12:40,015
- saying she turns you on
is the harassment, dude.	|Troy Pierce

290
00:12:40,702 --> 00:12:41,859
- hey.	|Pierce Troy

291
00:12:42,792 --> 00:12:45,790
I am a prominent business leader
And a highly sought after dinner guest

292
00:12:45,791 --> 00:12:49,775
And i will not take courting advice
From some teenage boy.	|Pierce Group

293
00:12:49,776 --> 00:12:53,196
well, this teenage boy 
is a quarterback and a prom king.	|Troy Pierce

294
00:12:53,197 --> 00:12:56,573
- you're not prom king anymore, troy.
This isn't riverside high.	|Annie Troy

295
00:12:56,574 --> 00:12:58,199
- how'd you know
i went there?	|Troy Annie

296
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:02,569
- because you're still wearing
your stupid letter jacket.

297
00:13:02,570 --> 00:13:05,289
And more importantly, I sat behind you
in Algebra.	|Annie Troy

298
00:13:06,018 --> 00:13:08,821
Wait, you're that girl that got hooked on pills
and then dropped out.

299
00:13:08,822 --> 00:13:10,611
You're little Annie "Adderall".	|Troy Jeff

300
00:13:10,612 --> 00:13:13,949
Yes, and you are a stupid jock
who lost his scholarship

301
00:13:13,950 --> 00:13:16,100
by dislocating both shoulders
in a keg stand.	|Annie Troy

302
00:13:16,101 --> 00:13:18,228
Keg flip.
They're very hard to pull off.

303
00:13:18,229 --> 00:13:21,425
You don't know--
I'm a legend.	|Troy Annie

304
00:13:26,597 --> 00:13:28,601
You know what I got
for Christmas?

305
00:13:29,684 --> 00:13:32,491
It was a banner year
at the Bender family.

306
00:13:32,492 --> 00:13:34,832
I got a carton
of cigarettes.

307
00:13:34,833 --> 00:13:38,583
The old man grabbed me, he said,
"Hey, smoke up, Johnny!"

308
00:13:39,833 --> 00:13:42,047
"No, dad!
What about you?"	|Abed Group

309
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:46,823
Well, uh...
that--

310
00:13:47,062 --> 00:13:49,970
That actually was from
The Breakfast Club.	|Jeff Abed

311
00:13:51,068 --> 00:13:53,040
Nobody puts baby
in the corner.	|Abed Jeff

312
00:13:53,897 --> 00:13:55,462
Dirty Dancing.

313
00:13:55,463 --> 00:13:57,180
Hello.	|Jeff Group
It's Professor Duncan.

314
00:13:57,181 --> 00:13:59,276
Come to the parking lot now.	|Duncan Jeff

315
00:13:59,403 --> 00:14:00,990
What's wrong
with your voice?	|Jeff Duncan

316
00:14:00,991 --> 00:14:02,484
I'm disguising it.	|Duncan Jeff

317
00:14:04,396 --> 00:14:05,396
Uh, I'll be right back.

318
00:14:05,397 --> 00:14:08,967
But while I'm gone, you guys need
to hash this stuff out.

319
00:14:08,968 --> 00:14:10,968
No stone unturned.

320
00:14:11,133 --> 00:14:12,817
- Go!	|Jeff Group
- What does that...	|Pierce Group

321
00:14:12,818 --> 00:14:16,105
- I can't feel my...	|Abed Group


322
00:14:21,051 --> 00:14:22,490
Get in the car!

323
00:14:25,532 --> 00:14:29,166
Act as if either you have just finished
or yet to begin driving.

324
00:14:30,737 --> 00:14:34,349
Every answer to every test
in your curriculum this semester.	|Duncan Jeff

325
00:14:34,350 --> 00:14:36,427
I knew you could
do it, buddy. Thank you.	|Jeff Duncan

326
00:14:36,428 --> 00:14:38,273
Whoa there, grabby-grabby.

327
00:14:38,852 --> 00:14:42,132
- What do I get?	|Duncan Jeff
- The satisfaction of being even.	|Jeff Duncan

328
00:14:42,133 --> 00:14:45,049
Even, fairness, right, wrong.
There is no God.

329
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:47,350
- Booyah, booyah.	|Duncan Jeff
- What do you want from me?	|Jeff Duncan

330
00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:50,760
- Your Lexus.	|Duncan Jeff
- My car for a semester's worth of answers?	|Jeff Duncan

331
00:14:50,761 --> 00:14:53,143
Will it be just
a semester though, Jeff?

332
00:14:53,144 --> 00:14:56,426
Won't you be taking the easy way out
for the next four years?

333
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:58,349
I want payment in advance.

334
00:14:58,350 --> 00:15:00,950
I want leather seats
with built-in ball warmers.	|Duncan Jeff

335
00:15:00,951 --> 00:15:04,890
You know, bluffs this weak are how
your people lost the colonies.	|Jeff Duncan

336
00:15:04,891 --> 00:15:07,175
Have a nice disbarment
hearing.	|Duncan Jeff

337
00:15:08,308 --> 00:15:11,173
- What am I supposed to drive?	|Jeff Duncan
- Why don't you take this car? It's good for the earth.	|Duncan Jeff

338
00:15:11,174 --> 00:15:14,490
Yeah, so is wiping your butt with a leaf,
but it's not how a man gets around!

339
00:15:20,804 --> 00:15:22,106
A golf kart!	|Jeff

340
00:15:27,997 --> 00:15:31,312
- It is a disaster in there.	|Britta Jeff
- Yeah, untutorable.

341
00:15:31,716 --> 00:15:34,318
- You like Thai food? I love Thai food.	|Jeff Britta
- Wait...

342
00:15:34,319 --> 00:15:35,874
so... this
is a game to you?

343
00:15:35,875 --> 00:15:38,979
You put human beings
into a state of emotional shambles

344
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:40,592
for a shot
at getting in my pants?	|Britta Jeff

345
00:15:40,593 --> 00:15:43,287
Why can't you see that
for the compliment that it is?

346
00:15:44,008 --> 00:15:46,824
Ok, ok. I'm sorry.
It was an accident.

347
00:15:47,218 --> 00:15:49,775
I did a little bit of lying 
to get close to you.

348
00:15:49,925 --> 00:15:52,833
But how was I suppose to know
that you were smart and cool...

349
00:15:52,834 --> 00:15:54,643
I mean, you look like Elisabeth Shue.	|Jeff Britta

350
00:15:54,644 --> 00:15:56,281
- You're unbelievable.	|Britta Jeff
- What do you want me to do?	|Jeff Britta

351
00:15:56,282 --> 00:16:00,342
Oh, maybe one decent thing could be
to go in there and clean up your mess.	|Britta Jeff

352
00:16:00,343 --> 00:16:03,459
Okay, I am the Barack Obama
of this room.	|Troy Group

353
00:16:03,755 --> 00:16:06,655
Okay, if i do that,
then dinner, right?	|Jeff Britta

354
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:10,723
Yeah, fine, whatever.

355
00:16:10,724 --> 00:16:15,227
As if there's a dinner on Earth that could
make me forget you are a shallow douchebag.	|Britta Jeff

356
00:16:15,228 --> 00:16:18,326
Oh, you're gonna eat those words
when you see my new car.	|Jeff Britta

357
00:16:24,441 --> 00:16:26,344
All right, everybody!

358
00:16:26,797 --> 00:16:28,897
I want to say something.
Everybody, sit down.	|Jeff Group

359
00:16:29,508 --> 00:16:32,134
You don't have to yell.	|Shirley Jeff

360
00:16:34,529 --> 00:16:36,693
You know what makes humans
different from other animals?	|Jeff Group

361
00:16:36,694 --> 00:16:37,865
Feet.	|Troy Jeff

362
00:16:38,111 --> 00:16:40,166
No, no, no, come on.
Bears have feet.	|Pierce Troy

363
00:16:40,167 --> 00:16:43,995
We're the only species on Earth
that observes Shark Week.

364
00:16:44,604 --> 00:16:47,518
Sharks don't even observe
Shark Week, but we do.

365
00:16:47,749 --> 00:16:51,278
For the same reason I can pick up this pencil,
tell you it's name is Steve,

366
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:52,830
and go like this.

367
00:16:53,123 --> 00:16:56,573
And part of you dies just
a little bit on the inside,

368
00:16:56,739 --> 00:16:59,647
because people can connect
with anything.

369
00:16:59,879 --> 00:17:01,470
We can sympathize
with a pencil.

370
00:17:01,471 --> 00:17:05,562
We can forgive a shark. And we can give
Ben Affleck an Academy Award for Screenwriting.	|Jeff Group

371
00:17:05,563 --> 00:17:06,666
- Big mistake.	|Pierce Group
- He's got a point.	|Troy Pierce

372
00:17:06,667 --> 00:17:11,265
People can find the good
in just about anything but themselves.

373
00:17:11,513 --> 00:17:14,628
Look at me. It's clear to
all of you that I am awesome,

374
00:17:14,914 --> 00:17:17,648
but I can never admit that,
because that would make me an ass.

375
00:17:17,649 --> 00:17:20,606
But what I can do is see
what makes Annie awesome.

376
00:17:20,607 --> 00:17:21,707
She's driven.

377
00:17:21,739 --> 00:17:25,107
We need driven people or the lights go out
and the ice cream melts.

378
00:17:25,108 --> 00:17:27,643
And Pierce.
We need guys like Pierce.

379
00:17:27,644 --> 00:17:29,904
This guy has
wisdom to offer.	|Jeff Group

380
00:17:29,905 --> 00:17:32,591
- The Dalai Lama and I--	|Pierce Group
- We should listen to him sometime.

381
00:17:32,592 --> 00:17:33,740
We wouldn't regret it.

382
00:17:33,741 --> 00:17:34,833
And Shirley.

383
00:17:35,078 --> 00:17:37,043
Shirley has earned
our respect,

384
00:17:37,044 --> 00:17:40,166
Not as a wife, not as a mother,
but as a woman.

385
00:17:40,391 --> 00:17:42,870
And don't test her on that,
because that thing about the jukebox

386
00:17:42,871 --> 00:17:44,915
was way too specific
to be improvised.

387
00:17:44,916 --> 00:17:45,991
And Troy.

388
00:17:46,149 --> 00:17:48,744
Who cares if Troy
thinks he's all that?

389
00:17:48,745 --> 00:17:49,995
Maybe he is.

390
00:17:50,030 --> 00:17:53,017
You think astronauts go to the moon
because they hate oxygen? No!

391
00:17:53,018 --> 00:17:56,051
They're trying to impress
their high-school prom king.

392
00:17:56,052 --> 00:17:57,227
And Abed.

393
00:17:57,518 --> 00:17:59,138
Abed's a shaman.

394
00:17:59,139 --> 00:18:02,685
You ask him to pass the salt,
he gives you a bowl of soup,

395
00:18:02,693 --> 00:18:05,288
because you know what?
Soup is better.

396
00:18:05,289 --> 00:18:06,639
Abed is better.

397
00:18:06,645 --> 00:18:09,129
You are all better
than you think you are.

398
00:18:09,305 --> 00:18:12,214
You are just designed not to believe it
when you hear it from yourself.	|Jeff Group

399
00:18:12,356 --> 00:18:13,425
Soup?	|Pierce Abed

400
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:16,024
I want you to look
to the person to your left.

401
00:18:17,172 --> 00:18:19,782
Sorry. Look at the person
sitting next to you.	|Jeff Group

402
00:18:19,783 --> 00:18:21,087
Look at her?
Okay.	|Shirley Jeff

403
00:18:21,088 --> 00:18:22,445
- This?	|Abed 
- Yeah.

404
00:18:22,446 --> 00:18:25,228
I want you to extend
to that person

405
00:18:25,555 --> 00:18:29,405
the same compassion that you extend
to sharks, pencils, and Ben Affleck.

406
00:18:29,498 --> 00:18:31,395
I want you to say
to that person,

407
00:18:31,396 --> 00:18:32,546
"I forgive you."	|Jeff Group

408
00:18:33,681 --> 00:18:35,484
- I forgive you.	|Shirley Annie
- I forgive you.	|Annie Shirley

409
00:18:35,714 --> 00:18:37,638
- I forgive you.	|Troy Pierce
- You little twerp.	|Pierce Troy

410
00:18:37,870 --> 00:18:39,872
Pierce, I'd like you to say,
"I forgive you."	|Jeff Pierce

411
00:18:40,145 --> 00:18:41,395
He didn't say it?	|Shirley Jeff

412
00:18:41,856 --> 00:18:42,959
I forgive you.	|Pierce Troy

413
00:18:43,149 --> 00:18:45,249
You've just stopped being
a study group.

414
00:18:45,576 --> 00:18:47,125
You have become something...

415
00:18:47,186 --> 00:18:48,536
unstoppable.

416
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:50,973
I hereby pronounce you...

417
00:18:51,241 --> 00:18:52,534
a community.	|Jeff Group

418
00:18:53,021 --> 00:18:54,221
Oh, that's nice.

419
00:18:54,603 --> 00:18:55,703
I like that.	|Shirley Group

420
00:18:58,903 --> 00:19:00,657
This isn't like
Breakfast Club anymore.

421
00:19:00,658 --> 00:19:02,959
Now it's like Stripes or Meatballs.
Anything with Bill Murray, really.	|Abed Jeff

422
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:05,960
I agree with Abed that tonight
has been very special.

423
00:19:06,656 --> 00:19:08,122
And now,
if you'll excuse me,

424
00:19:08,123 --> 00:19:10,175
I have a dinner engagement
with Britta.

425
00:19:10,745 --> 00:19:11,810
Britta?	|Jeff Group

426
00:19:12,038 --> 00:19:13,279
I lied.

427
00:19:14,047 --> 00:19:15,844
Thanks for calming
everyone down.

428
00:19:15,845 --> 00:19:18,622
but since you're not a Spanish tutor,
just a lying creep

429
00:19:18,623 --> 00:19:21,864
who purposely upset everyone
in an attempt to get with me,

430
00:19:21,865 --> 00:19:25,569
I'd appreciate it if you left
and stopped wasting all of our time.	|Britta Jeff

431
00:19:25,570 --> 00:19:26,964
Everybody ready?	|Britta Group

432
00:19:28,382 --> 00:19:29,509
Fine.	|Jeff Britta

433
00:19:30,693 --> 00:19:32,543
And I'm happy to report

434
00:19:32,683 --> 00:19:35,557
that one of the benefits
of being a lying creep

435
00:19:35,726 --> 00:19:38,651
is having all the answers
to tomorrow's test.

436
00:19:38,859 --> 00:19:41,945
And I'm happy to share them with anyone
whose time I've wasted more

437
00:19:41,946 --> 00:19:43,801
than they've wasted mine.	|Jeff Group

438
00:19:43,802 --> 00:19:48,082
Uh, Jeff, if you have all the answers,
why the hell did you start this study group?	|Pierce Jeff

439
00:19:48,083 --> 00:19:50,035
I don't have a study group, Pierce.
I made it up.	|Jeff Pierce

440
00:19:50,036 --> 00:19:52,655
- What about the "Look Left" speech?	|Annie Jeff
- Made it up. That's what I do.	|Jeff Annie

441
00:19:52,656 --> 00:19:56,339
I make things up,
and I got paid a lot of money

442
00:19:56,340 --> 00:19:58,555
to do it before I came
to this school-shaped toilet.

443
00:19:58,556 --> 00:19:59,994
I was a lawyer.	|Jeff Group

444
00:20:00,291 --> 00:20:02,058
- Oh, God.	|Group
- That explains everything.	|Shirley Group

445
00:20:02,998 --> 00:20:06,960
You know, I thought you were like Bill Murray in any of
his films, but you're more like Michael Douglas in any of his films.	|Abed Jeff

446
00:20:06,961 --> 00:20:08,026
- Yeah?	|Jeff Abed
- Yeah.	|Abed Jeff

447
00:20:08,027 --> 00:20:09,440
Well, you have Asperger's.	|Jeff Abed

448
00:20:10,950 --> 00:20:12,100
What did he say?	|Abed Britta

449
00:20:13,187 --> 00:20:14,187
"Ass-burger".	|Troy

450
00:20:14,188 --> 00:20:16,383
- It's a serious disorder.	|Annie Troy
- It really is.	|Shirley Troy

451
00:20:16,384 --> 00:20:18,752
If it's so serious,
why don't they call it meningitis?	|Pierce Annie Shirley

452
00:20:21,170 --> 00:20:23,194
- "Ass-burger".	|Pierce
- Burger for your ass.	|Troy Pierce

454
00:20:46,287 --> 00:20:49,467
Jeffrey, before you say anything, you may
want to think about the gift you've been given.	|Duncan Jeff

455
00:20:49,468 --> 00:20:52,282
- An excuse to punch a hippy?	|Jeff Pierce
- No. No, not that.

456
00:20:52,283 --> 00:20:55,120
An important lesson,
my friend. You see,

457
00:20:55,474 --> 00:20:59,613
the tools you acquired to survive out there
will not help you here at Greendale.

458
00:20:59,614 --> 00:21:03,248
What you have, my friend,
is a second chance at an honest life.	|Duncan Jeff

459
00:21:03,249 --> 00:21:06,040
Why are people trying 
to teach me things

460
00:21:06,074 --> 00:21:09,027
At a school that has
an express tuition aisle?

461
00:21:09,324 --> 00:21:12,552
- Give me the keys.	|Jeff Duncan
- No, I have to keep your car for--

462
00:21:12,553 --> 00:21:14,304
Don't hit me.
Please, don't hit me.

463
00:21:14,464 --> 00:21:15,902
Jeffrey, Jeffrey!

464
00:21:16,259 --> 00:21:17,709
Are we cool?

465
00:21:18,168 --> 00:21:19,358
Are we cool?

466
00:21:21,203 --> 00:21:22,360
We're cool.	|Duncan Jeff

467
00:21:24,352 --> 00:21:25,902
I like you, Jeffrey.

468
00:21:27,893 --> 00:21:30,393
You remind me of myself
at your age.	|Pierce Jeff

469
00:21:31,391 --> 00:21:32,541
I deserve that.	|Jeff Pierce

470
00:21:33,010 --> 00:21:34,227
You know,

471
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:36,265
I've been divorced

472
00:21:36,836 --> 00:21:38,012
seven times.

473
00:21:39,454 --> 00:21:41,441
Sometimes, I think I'm doing
something wrong.	|Pierce Jeff

474
00:21:47,311 --> 00:21:49,311
You keep getting married.	|Jeff Pierce

475
00:21:50,076 --> 00:21:51,844
I never looked at it
that way.	|Pierce Jeff

476
00:21:55,142 --> 00:21:57,158
Shouldn't you guys
be studying?	|Jeff Pierce Troy

477
00:21:57,159 --> 00:21:59,874
Yeah, things got kind
of boring after you left.

478
00:22:00,004 --> 00:22:01,517
Let me ask you something.

479
00:22:01,872 --> 00:22:04,888
People becloud me for wearing this jacket
ever since I got here, but 

480
00:22:05,377 --> 00:22:07,091
If I take it off to make them happy,

481
00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:09,170
That just makes me weak, right?	|Troy Jeff

482
00:22:09,326 --> 00:22:10,455
Listen,

483
00:22:10,611 --> 00:22:11,954
it doesn't matter.

484
00:22:11,955 --> 00:22:14,959
You lose the jacket to please them,
you keep it to piss them off,

485
00:22:15,330 --> 00:22:16,480
Either way

486
00:22:16,481 --> 00:22:17,781
It's for them.

487
00:22:18,157 --> 00:22:19,610
That's what's weak..	|Jeff Troy

488
00:22:20,455 --> 00:22:21,631
Wow.

489
00:22:22,995 --> 00:22:24,778
You just wrinkled my brain, man.	|Troy Jeff

490
00:22:24,779 --> 00:22:26,724
- He's good, isn't he?	|Pierce Troy
- He's really good.	|Troy Pierce

491
00:22:26,725 --> 00:22:30,208
Shouldn't you be rolling around
on a bed covered in test answers?	|Britta Jeff

492
00:22:33,664 --> 00:22:35,328
I don't have any
of the answers.

493
00:22:36,057 --> 00:22:37,866
I'm gonna--
I'm gonna flunk the test.	|Jeff Group

494
00:22:37,867 --> 00:22:40,424
You just, like, study for, like, an hour.
It's not that hard.

495
00:22:40,648 --> 00:22:42,678
You seem pretty smart.
You got a sports coat.	|Troy Jeff

496
00:22:42,679 --> 00:22:43,829
I am me...

497
00:22:44,102 --> 00:22:45,620
Well, the funny thing
about being smart

498
00:22:45,621 --> 00:22:48,571
is that you can get through most of life
without ever having to do any work.

499
00:22:48,910 --> 00:22:50,079
So, uh...

500
00:22:50,887 --> 00:22:52,868
I'm not really sure
how to do that.	|Jeff Group

502
00:23:05,543 --> 00:23:06,601
What's going on?

503
00:23:06,602 --> 00:23:08,286
Can you guys hear me?
Am I deaf?

504
00:23:08,287 --> 00:23:10,529
- Can you hear me talking right now?	|Abed Group
- Yes.	|Group Abed

505
00:23:10,530 --> 00:23:11,730
That's good.	|Abed Group

506
00:23:13,905 --> 00:23:14,905
You know what?

507
00:23:14,906 --> 00:23:18,266
Jeff, actually, we didn't
get that far without you, so

508
00:23:18,267 --> 00:23:20,471
if you want
to come back upstairs--	|Britta Jeff

509
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:24,672
Really?	|Jeff Britta

510
00:23:25,056 --> 00:23:27,301
Well, it is your
study group, so.	|Britta Jeff

511
00:23:27,391 --> 00:23:28,691
Come on, let's study.	|Shirley Jeff

512
00:23:28,782 --> 00:23:29,932
Sounds good.	|Pierce Group

513
00:23:30,145 --> 00:23:31,445
No pressure.	|Troy Jeff

514
00:23:41,452 --> 00:23:44,439
I'm sorry I called you Michael Douglas
and I see your value now.	|Abed Jeff

515
00:23:46,599 --> 00:23:49,899
Well, that's the nicest thing
anyone's ever said to me.	|Jeff Abed
