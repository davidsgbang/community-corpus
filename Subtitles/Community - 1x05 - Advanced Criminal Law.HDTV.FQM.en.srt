1
00:00:00,567 --> 00:00:02,101
- good morning,
greendale community college.

2
00:00:02,168 --> 00:00:04,034
This is your dean
reminding you

3
00:00:04,101 --> 00:00:06,434
That among your school's
prestigious alumni

4
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:09,001
Is mr. luis guzman,
celebrated actor

5
00:00:09,068 --> 00:00:11,267
And model
puerto-rican american.

6
00:00:11,333 --> 00:00:15,233
This friday, we will be
dedicating a statue of guzman

7
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:17,300
And unveiling
our brand-new school song.

8
00:00:17,367 --> 00:00:19,934
So boy,
i don't know about you,

9
00:00:20,001 --> 00:00:22,867
But this sure feels like
a real college to me.	|Dean All	|01

10
00:00:22,934 --> 00:00:24,834
- greendale, greendale,

11
00:00:24,901 --> 00:00:26,267
Greendale!	|DeanBot	|01

13
00:00:29,333 --> 00:00:30,667
- ah! Jeff, Jeff.

14
00:00:30,734 --> 00:00:32,101
Good morning!

15
00:00:32,168 --> 00:00:35,134
How is student life,
my dry-witted friend?	|Duncan Jeff	|02

16
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:36,567
- probably the same
as teacher life,

17
00:00:36,634 --> 00:00:38,367
But less tragic,
because i get to leave.	|Jeff Duncan	|02

18
00:00:38,434 --> 00:00:40,001
- very dry.
very witty.

19
00:00:40,068 --> 00:00:41,467
Not a great friend.

20
00:00:41,534 --> 00:00:43,767
Listen, i wanted to ask you
about that young lady

21
00:00:43,834 --> 00:00:45,168
In your spanish class.

22
00:00:45,233 --> 00:00:47,400
You know, the blonde
with the pouty, strident

23
00:00:47,467 --> 00:00:50,200
Cate blanchett sexuality
and the ridiculous name?	|Duncan Jeff	|02

24
00:00:50,267 --> 00:00:52,400
- Britta?	|Jeff Duncan	|02
- that's it, that's it.

25
00:00:52,467 --> 00:00:55,233
Imagine living with that.
can you imagine?

26
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:56,767
Unbelievable.

27
00:00:56,834 --> 00:00:59,367
Anyway, are you two an item,
and if so,

28
00:00:59,434 --> 00:01:01,867
Would that item be
impervious to sabotage?	|Duncan Jeff	|02

29
00:01:01,934 --> 00:01:04,801
- you know, you have
the savoir faire of a hyena.

30
00:01:04,867 --> 00:01:06,233
How is it that you
and james bond

31
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:07,567
Come from the same island?	|Jeff Duncan	|02

32
00:01:07,634 --> 00:01:09,034
- message received.

33
00:01:09,101 --> 00:01:11,134
I'll just wait for you
to finish striking out first.

34
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:12,367
- cheers.	|Duncan Jeff	|02
- m.a.s.h.	|Abed Duncan	|03

35
00:01:12,434 --> 00:01:13,300
- fawlty towers.
game over.	|Duncan Abed	|03

36
00:01:13,367 --> 00:01:16,168
Have a nice day.	|Duncan Jeff	|02

37
00:01:17,233 --> 00:01:18,333
- do you think luis guzman

38
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,168
Will ever come
to visit his statue?

39
00:01:20,233 --> 00:01:21,834
If so, i'd like to ask him
about his movie choices,

40
00:01:21,901 --> 00:01:24,634
particularly carlito's way,
the cowboy way, the hard way,

41
00:01:24,701 --> 00:01:26,134
and q&a.	|Abed Troy	|04

42
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:28,434
- yeah, luis guzman is
on a private jet from hollywood,

43
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:31,168
Because he can't wait to have
that conversation with you.	|Troy Abed	|04

44
00:01:31,233 --> 00:01:32,667
- really?
how does he know about me?	|Abed Troy	|04

45
00:01:32,734 --> 00:01:34,801
- because he called me
on my cell phone.	|Troy Abed	|04

46
00:01:34,867 --> 00:01:38,934
- why would a movie actor
call you?	|Abed Troy	|04

47
00:01:39,001 --> 00:01:41,567
- you don't know?	|Troy Abed	|04
- no.	|Abed Troy	|04

48
00:01:41,634 --> 00:01:43,667
- i'm president obama's nephew.	|Troy Abed	|04

49
00:01:43,734 --> 00:01:45,001
- you never mentioned that.	|Abed Troy	|04

50
00:01:45,068 --> 00:01:46,534
- i didn't know
if i could trust you.

51
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:48,434
But now it's time
to tell you everything--

52
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:50,101
Starting with me
inventing the ferrari.	|Troy Abed	|04

53
00:01:50,168 --> 00:01:53,101
- so...i guess
the cell phone number

54
00:01:53,168 --> 00:01:55,467
You put on the study group's
contact sheet was fake,

55
00:01:55,534 --> 00:01:57,434
Which i just learned
in the awkward conclusion

56
00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:00,434
Of a month-long text message
affair with a dude from boulder.	|Jeff Britta	|05

57
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:02,068
- sorry.	|Britta Jeff	|05
- that's okay.

58
00:02:02,134 --> 00:02:03,600
Just give me
your real number.

59
00:02:03,667 --> 00:02:05,734
I'll cleanse my palate while
kevin rethinks his marriage.	|Jeff Britta	|05

60
00:02:05,801 --> 00:02:07,734
I'll give you my number
if you promise not to use it

61
00:02:07,801 --> 00:02:09,567
In any other context
than friendship.	|Britta Jeff	|05

62
00:02:09,634 --> 00:02:10,934
- uh...pass.	|Jeff Britta	|05

63
00:02:11,001 --> 00:02:13,767
- silencio, por favor.	|Chang All	|06

64
00:02:13,834 --> 00:02:16,168
Star burns--
that means you.	|Chang Starburns	|06

65
00:02:16,233 --> 00:02:18,134
- my name's alex, dude.	|Starburns Chang	|06

66
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:19,267
- well, maybe you should
spend five hours

67
00:02:19,333 --> 00:02:21,667
Sculpting that
in your face.	|Chang Starburns	|06

68
00:02:21,734 --> 00:02:23,567
All right, last night
i graded your tests.

69
00:02:23,634 --> 00:02:24,967
I'm sure you wanna know
how you did, right?	|Chang All	|06

70
00:02:25,034 --> 00:02:27,168
- yes, i would.	|All Chang	|06
- well, i'm not gonna tell you.

71
00:02:27,233 --> 00:02:31,701
Until i find out
who did...this!	|Chang All	|06

72
00:02:31,767 --> 00:02:34,500
- what is that?	|Shirley Chang	|06

73
00:02:34,567 --> 00:02:36,701
- it's a tiny piece of paper,
okay?

74
00:02:36,767 --> 00:02:38,901
That's all it is.
tiny piece of paper.	|Chang Shirley	|06

75
00:02:38,967 --> 00:02:42,467
Containing all the information
covered on the test.

76
00:02:42,534 --> 00:02:45,400
Otherwise known
as a crib sheet.

77
00:02:45,467 --> 00:02:47,267
Who did it, huh?	|Chang All	|06

78
00:02:47,333 --> 00:02:50,068
Marianne?	|Chang Annie	|06

79
00:02:50,134 --> 00:02:52,034
grandpa?	|Chang Pierce	|06

80
00:02:52,101 --> 00:02:53,634
Jackee?	|Chang Shirley	|06

81
00:02:53,701 --> 00:02:55,134
Kumar?	|Chang Abed	|06

82
00:02:55,233 --> 00:02:57,300
There's one asian stereotype
that does apply to me.

83
00:02:57,367 --> 00:02:59,801
Whoever did this
insulted my honor.

84
00:02:59,867 --> 00:03:02,934
And they've got 24 hours
to come forward,

85
00:03:03,001 --> 00:03:06,333
Or mr. miyagi here
will wax off everyone's score

86
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:11,367
and the whole class
gets a cero!	|Chang All	|06

87
00:03:11,434 --> 00:03:14,834
'cept you, toby.	|Chang Extra	|06

89
00:03:21,001 --> 00:03:23,534
- the only difference between
senor chang and stalin

90
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:25,767
Is that i know
who senor chang is.	|Troy Group	|07

91
00:03:25,834 --> 00:03:27,200
- did you hear him call me
jackee

92
00:03:27,267 --> 00:03:28,500
Like i'm some black
female caricature?

93
00:03:28,567 --> 00:03:30,168
If the good lord
hadn't been watching,

94
00:03:30,233 --> 00:03:32,267
I'd have slapped him
upside the head.	|Shirley Group	|07

95
00:03:32,333 --> 00:03:34,667
- who do you guys think
cheated?	|Pierce Group	|07

96
00:03:34,734 --> 00:03:35,634
- flattering.

97
00:03:35,701 --> 00:03:37,233
But if i'm gonna cheat,

98
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:38,834
I'm not gonna write
information from a book

99
00:03:38,901 --> 00:03:40,267
Onto a piece of paper.

100
00:03:40,333 --> 00:03:41,634
That's practically learning,
for god's sakes.

101
00:03:41,701 --> 00:03:43,567
Whoever made that crib sheet
wasn't a real cheater.

102
00:03:43,634 --> 00:03:47,233
Just...insecure and naive.	|Jeff Group	|07

103
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:50,200
- i may be naive,
but i'm not stupid.	|Annie Jeff	|07

104
00:03:50,267 --> 00:03:51,867
- well, i may be stupid,

105
00:03:51,934 --> 00:03:54,367
But i'm not trying
to look like i'm not.	|Troy Annie	|07

106
00:03:54,434 --> 00:03:57,200
- well, i may be a genius,
but i'm not a lesbian.	|Pierce Britta	|07

108
00:03:58,600 --> 00:03:59,734
Who cares who made
the crib sheet?

109
00:03:59,801 --> 00:04:01,233
The only real cheater

110
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:03,233
Is the guy who's threatening
everyone with a zero.	|Britta Group	|07

111
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:05,101
- you're right!
it's so unfair.

112
00:04:05,168 --> 00:04:07,434
And i can't handle
this kind of stress right now.	|Annie Group	|06

113
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:09,168
I'm already overwhelmed
by my duties

114
00:04:09,233 --> 00:04:10,701
On the school song committee.	|Annie Group	|07
- are you a musician?	|Pierce Annie	|07

115
00:04:10,767 --> 00:04:13,068
- eew. no.
i hired a local composer.

116
00:04:13,134 --> 00:04:14,834
But he's quite a handful.	|Annie Pierce	|07

117
00:04:14,901 --> 00:04:16,500
- well, i guess that's
your fault, isn't it?	|Pierce Annie	|07

118
00:04:16,567 --> 00:04:18,667
- it is?	|Annie Pierce	|07
- you've got an accomplished

119
00:04:18,734 --> 00:04:20,834
Pianist and songwriter
sitting 3 feet away from you.

120
00:04:20,901 --> 00:04:22,134
I wrote the jingle

121
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:24,168
For hawthorne wipe's
moist towelettes.

122
00:04:24,233 --> 00:04:25,600
I would have done
your song for free.

123
00:04:25,667 --> 00:04:28,300
Smooth move, metamucil.	|Pierce Annie	|07
- troy could do the school song.

124
00:04:28,367 --> 00:04:29,901
Troy invited rap music,

125
00:04:29,967 --> 00:04:31,734
And he's related to danny glover
and president obama.	|Abed Group	|08

126
00:04:31,801 --> 00:04:33,767
- abed, have you been
racist this whole time

127
00:04:33,834 --> 00:04:35,233
While i'm telling
everybody at church

128
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:37,168
What a sweet little
caramel angel you are?	|Shirley Abed	|08

129
00:04:37,233 --> 00:04:39,500
- hey, man, that stuff
i said this morning wasn't true.

130
00:04:39,567 --> 00:04:41,567
I was just messin' with you.	|Troy Abed	|08
- you were lying?	|Abed Troy	|08

131
00:04:41,634 --> 00:04:42,934
- yeah, as a joke.

132
00:04:43,001 --> 00:04:44,434
You've never had anybody
mess with you before?	|Troy Abed	|08

133
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:47,867
- yes. just kidding.
no. like that?

134
00:04:49,367 --> 00:04:51,001
This isn't a table.

135
00:04:51,068 --> 00:04:53,101
Ha ha!
that's funny.	|Abed Troy	|08

136
00:04:53,168 --> 00:04:55,634
- remember when we used to
study spanish?	|Jeff Britta	|09

137
00:04:59,367 --> 00:05:00,500
- pierce!	|Annie Pierce	|10
- yo.	|Pierce Annie	|10

138
00:05:00,567 --> 00:05:01,934
- i talked to the dean,

139
00:05:02,001 --> 00:05:03,934
And he said you can write
greendale's school song.	|Annie Pierce	|10

140
00:05:04,001 --> 00:05:05,333
- well, that's more like it.	|Pierce Annie	|10

141
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:07,134
- you know the statue
dedication is this friday.

142
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:08,667
So you have to have it done
by then.	|Annie Pierce	|10

143
00:05:08,734 --> 00:05:10,434
- this friday?
this friday?	|Pierce Annie	|10

144
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:11,834
- if that's not enough time--	|Annie Pierce	|10
- no, no, no!

145
00:05:11,901 --> 00:05:13,901
You really don't know much
about genius, do you?

146
00:05:13,967 --> 00:05:15,767
Yes, i can do it by friday.	|Pierce Annie	|10
- great!

147
00:05:15,834 --> 00:05:17,467
There's a piano
in the rehearsal space,

148
00:05:17,534 --> 00:05:19,434
And i'll help you out
however i can.

149
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:21,333
You're gonna do
an awesome job!	|Annie Pierce	|10

150
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:22,467
- i know!	|Pierce Annie	|10

151
00:05:22,534 --> 00:05:26,001
- so...this is the last chance

152
00:05:26,068 --> 00:05:28,434
For the cheater
to be an adult

153
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:31,300
and face la musica...

154
00:05:31,367 --> 00:05:33,801
Or everyone fails.	|Chang All	|11
- no!	|Annie Chang	|11

155
00:05:33,867 --> 00:05:36,034
- you got ten seconds...

156
00:05:36,101 --> 00:05:37,333
Starting now.	|Chang All	|11

158
00:05:45,267 --> 00:05:48,300
- no!

159
00:05:48,367 --> 00:05:51,300
I've never...
gotten a zero before.	|Annie All	|11

160
00:05:51,367 --> 00:05:53,001
- i did it.	|Britta Chang	|11
- Britta!	|Shirley Britta	|11

161
00:05:53,068 --> 00:05:56,734
- well, you really took your
sweet time with that one, baby.	|Chang Britta	|11

162
00:05:56,801 --> 00:05:59,300
- how dare you terrorize a class
by threatening their grades.

163
00:05:59,367 --> 00:06:02,001
It's not that easy to get human
beings to turn on each other.	|Britta Chang	|11

164
00:06:02,068 --> 00:06:05,200
- turn on her!	|Chang All	|11

165
00:06:05,267 --> 00:06:06,567
- ow!

166
00:06:06,634 --> 00:06:08,867
real mature!	|Britta All	|11

167
00:06:08,934 --> 00:06:11,901
- that's right.
we are mature!

168
00:06:11,967 --> 00:06:14,767
Too mature
to sit in a class

169
00:06:14,834 --> 00:06:18,701
With a cheating,
lying poop-face!	|Chang Britta	|11

170
00:06:18,767 --> 00:06:21,967
Okay. time to learn
some formal greetings.	|Chang All	|11

171
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:31,168
- so...

172
00:06:31,233 --> 00:06:32,434
Wow.	|Jeff Britta	|12

173
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:34,101
- yeah, i bet
you're enjoying this.	|Britta Jeff	|12

174
00:06:34,168 --> 00:06:35,701
- yeah, well,
when we first met,

175
00:06:35,767 --> 00:06:38,467
Like you were up here
and i was here, and now...

176
00:06:38,534 --> 00:06:40,567
Oh, wait, i gave a quarter
to a dirty bum today.	|Jeff Britta	|12

177
00:06:40,634 --> 00:06:42,400
- what do you think
they're gonna do to me?	|Britta Jeff	|12

178
00:06:42,467 --> 00:06:44,267
- well, we're not gonna
buy you an ice cream.

179
00:06:44,333 --> 00:06:45,734
Hi. dean pelton.

180
00:06:45,801 --> 00:06:47,233
What an entrance
i got to make there.

181
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:48,600
You would be Britta perry.

182
00:06:48,667 --> 00:06:51,333
I just spoke with senor chang,

183
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:53,434
And i'm afraid greendale
takes this kinda thing

184
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:54,701
Very seriously.	|Dean Britta	|12

185
00:06:54,767 --> 00:06:55,934
much like a university would!	|Dean All	|12

186
00:06:58,734 --> 00:07:01,200
Your case will be reviewed

187
00:07:01,267 --> 00:07:02,801
By a disciplinary tribunal
tomorrow

188
00:07:02,867 --> 00:07:04,034
In borchart hall.

189
00:07:04,101 --> 00:07:06,101
You could be facing
expulsion.	|Dean Britta	|12

190
00:07:06,168 --> 00:07:07,600
- isn't borchart hall
the pool?	|Jeff Dean	|12

191
00:07:07,667 --> 00:07:09,934
- there is an olympic-sized
pool there, yes,	|Dean Jeff	|12

192
00:07:10,001 --> 00:07:11,233
But we will be next to it,

193
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:14,233
using its $6,000 judge's table!	|Dean All	|12

194
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:15,967
- uh, is she allowed
to have counsel?

195
00:07:16,034 --> 00:07:18,300
I mean, i may not be
a practicing lawyer anymore,

196
00:07:18,367 --> 00:07:20,667
But relative to this place,
i'm alan dershowitz.	|Jeff Dean	|12

197
00:07:20,734 --> 00:07:22,801
- oh, okay, ouch,
and yes.

198
00:07:22,867 --> 00:07:24,534
If you'd like,
you may represent her.

199
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:25,967
Dean you later.	|Dean Jeff	|12

200
00:07:26,034 --> 00:07:28,233
- i'm not gonna sit
while some hokey tribunal

201
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:30,434
Gets its jollies judging me.	|Britta Jeff	|13

202
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:32,233
- hey, if you show up with me,
follow my lead,

203
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:34,367
And deny everything,
you'll walk.

204
00:07:34,434 --> 00:07:35,600
That's the winger guarantee.	|Jeff Britta	|13

205
00:07:35,667 --> 00:07:36,834
- i get it.

206
00:07:36,901 --> 00:07:38,233
You think
you're gonna save my bacon

207
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:39,534
Using your lawyer powers

208
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:41,734
And send me into fits
of grateful arousal.	|Britta Jeff	|13

209
00:07:41,801 --> 00:07:44,068
- i can neither confirm
nor deny that.

210
00:07:44,134 --> 00:07:46,200
See how good i am?	|Jeff Britta	|13

211
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:49,834
- hey, troy.
did you hear?

212
00:07:49,901 --> 00:07:52,701
All dogs are blue now.

213
00:07:52,767 --> 00:07:54,867
Every single dog
in the world is blue.

215
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,367
I'm just messing with you.	|Abed Troy	|14

216
00:07:59,434 --> 00:08:01,034
- yeah, i know,
but let me explain to you

217
00:08:01,101 --> 00:08:03,068
A few things
about how this works.

218
00:08:03,134 --> 00:08:05,400
Uh, first of all,
i cannot be got,

219
00:08:05,467 --> 00:08:07,434
Because i am not gullible
like you.

220
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:09,867
Secondly,
you are not good at this,

221
00:08:09,934 --> 00:08:12,934
Because you are not believable
in your face, okay?

222
00:08:13,001 --> 00:08:15,400
Your face? it's bad.	|Troy Abed	|14
- okay.	|Abed Troy	|14

223
00:08:15,467 --> 00:08:16,967
- um, also...

224
00:08:17,034 --> 00:08:18,867
You gotta ride the line
between believable and--

226
00:08:20,701 --> 00:08:22,300
- what are you writing in?	|Troy Abed	|14

227
00:08:22,367 --> 00:08:23,534
- it's a notepad.	|Abed Troy	|14

228
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:24,967
- yeah, but what are--
what language?	|Troy Abed	|14

229
00:08:25,034 --> 00:08:26,567
- it's probably arabic.	|Abed Troy	|14

232
00:08:35,801 --> 00:08:38,834
- all right, i am convening
this disciplinary tribunal

233
00:08:38,901 --> 00:08:41,400
At our state-of-the-art
judge's table,

234
00:08:41,467 --> 00:08:43,934
Which has
its own built-in sound system,

235
00:08:44,001 --> 00:08:45,500
So take that yale.

236
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:48,767
Our judges include myself,
uh, dean craig pelton.	|Dean All	|15

237
00:08:48,834 --> 00:08:50,467
- professor ian duncan.	|Duncan All	|15

238
00:08:50,534 --> 00:08:52,600
- professor ben chang.	|Chang All	|15

239
00:08:52,667 --> 00:08:54,834
- uh, no, you're a teacher.
you're not a professor.	|Duncan Chang	|15

240
00:08:54,901 --> 00:08:57,200
- maybe because
i don't look like ron weasley.	|Chang Duncan	|15

241
00:08:57,267 --> 00:08:58,200
- that's the difference.

242
00:08:58,267 --> 00:08:59,834
That's the qualifying factor.

243
00:08:59,901 --> 00:09:01,134
- gentlemen, point of order.	|Duncan Chang	|15

244
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,367
How can senor chang
be one of the judges?

245
00:09:03,434 --> 00:09:04,901
He's the one
accusing my client.	|Jeff Duncan Dean Chang	|15

246
00:09:04,967 --> 00:09:06,767
- yeah, well, you got
prince charles over here,

247
00:09:06,834 --> 00:09:08,101
Who's your drinking buddy.	|Chang Jeff Duncan	|15

248
00:09:08,168 --> 00:09:09,801
- oh, got me.	|Duncan Chang	|15

249
00:09:09,867 --> 00:09:11,634
- well, it sounds
like there are two biases,

250
00:09:11,701 --> 00:09:13,400
One on each side,
and i go both ways.

251
00:09:13,467 --> 00:09:14,801
Oh, let's strike that.	|Dean Jeff	|15

252
00:09:14,867 --> 00:09:17,300
Lashonda, can we please
strike that?	|Dean Extra	|15

253
00:09:17,367 --> 00:09:20,667
I am impartial,
so it should all work out.

254
00:09:20,734 --> 00:09:22,367
Okay. let's begin.	|Dean Jeff	|15

255
00:09:22,434 --> 00:09:26,233
- fine. the tribunal calls
teacher chang.	|Duncan Chang	|15

256
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:27,934
- okay, just keep it up
frost/nixon.	|Chang Duncan	|15

257
00:09:28,001 --> 00:09:29,367
- i was planning
on doing that.

258
00:09:29,434 --> 00:09:30,801
Cleared my whole day.

259
00:09:30,867 --> 00:09:34,001
Uh, mr. chang,
could you remind us

260
00:09:34,068 --> 00:09:35,567
Of the events
of yesterday?	|Duncan Chang	|15

261
00:09:35,634 --> 00:09:37,834
- with great pleasure.
it was a tuesday,

262
00:09:37,901 --> 00:09:40,434
Uh, crack of dawn,
5:58 a.m.

263
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:42,867
I got up,
i took my morning deuce,

264
00:09:42,934 --> 00:09:44,267
I made a breakfast
consisting of..	|Chang All	|15

265
00:09:47,101 --> 00:09:48,001
- * green-dale *

266
00:09:48,068 --> 00:09:49,068
* green-dale *

267
00:09:49,134 --> 00:09:50,567
* slop * 

268
00:09:50,634 --> 00:09:51,867
Mm, nah.

269
00:09:51,934 --> 00:09:52,967
* green *

270
00:09:53,034 --> 00:09:54,367
* gree--green *

271
00:09:54,434 --> 00:09:57,934
* greendale
isn't a slop pail *	|Pierce	|16

272
00:10:01,001 --> 00:10:02,734
hi, almost done.	|Pierce Annie	|16

273
00:10:02,801 --> 00:10:04,400
- oh, good.	|Annie Pierce	|16

274
00:10:04,467 --> 00:10:05,767
- you can tell the dean
i'll have a song

275
00:10:05,834 --> 00:10:07,534
That'll make the devil
poop god's pants.	|Pierce Annie	|16

276
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:10,233
- that's exciting.

277
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:11,801
Mind if i hear
what you got so far?	|Annie Pierce	|16

278
00:10:11,867 --> 00:10:13,734
- well, uh, yeah, sure.

279
00:10:13,801 --> 00:10:17,367
I, uh--i'll probably open
with something like this. uh...

281
00:10:18,534 --> 00:10:20,001
You know, a note like that.

282
00:10:20,068 --> 00:10:23,434
And end
with a note like that.

283
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:25,068
Uh, the words,
i can't tell you.

284
00:10:25,134 --> 00:10:28,168
You know, the rest
is really a surprise.	|Pierce Annie	|16

285
00:10:28,233 --> 00:10:29,934
- i'm just a little worried.

286
00:10:30,001 --> 00:10:31,333
I keep hearing
the same two notes,

287
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:33,600
And your sheet music

288
00:10:33,667 --> 00:10:35,068
Looks like
a chinese takeout menu.	|Annie Pierce	|16

289
00:10:35,134 --> 00:10:38,134
- a musician sees music
in everything, annie.

290
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:40,534
I mean, it could be...

291
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:43,233
* moo shoo pork *

292
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:45,534
* squab with lettuce * *

293
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,567
You see?
i mean, it just comes out.

294
00:10:47,634 --> 00:10:49,001
You know what? you really
shouldn't be here right now.	|Pierce Annie	|16

295
00:10:49,068 --> 00:10:50,267
- what?	|Annie Pierce	|16

296
00:10:50,333 --> 00:10:53,034
- you are inside
a throbbing, cosmic womb

297
00:10:53,101 --> 00:10:54,600
Of creativity,

298
00:10:54,667 --> 00:10:56,767
And when this baby
starts kicking,

299
00:10:56,834 --> 00:10:59,168
I cannot be responsible
for your sanity.

300
00:10:59,233 --> 00:11:01,200
i know it sounds funny,

301
00:11:01,267 --> 00:11:02,767
But let me
play you out, okay?

303
00:11:06,068 --> 00:11:07,367
Playing you out now,
this song.

304
00:11:07,434 --> 00:11:09,600
You know, like on stage?
playing you out, okay?

305
00:11:09,667 --> 00:11:11,434
Thanks for coming.
bye-bye.	|Pierce Annie	|16

309
00:11:22,534 --> 00:11:24,300
- and then she yelled,
"screw you,"

310
00:11:24,367 --> 00:11:26,367
Or, "screw education,"
or something like that,

311
00:11:26,434 --> 00:11:27,801
And then she stormed
out of the room

312
00:11:27,867 --> 00:11:29,934
In her high-heel boots
like it was tampon time...

313
00:11:30,001 --> 00:11:31,534
If you know what i mean.	|Chang All	|17

314
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,267
- objection.
i don't know what he means.	|Jeff All	|17

315
00:11:33,333 --> 00:11:35,001
- please don't
encourage him, winger.

316
00:11:35,068 --> 00:11:36,867
Do you have
any more questions?	|Duncan Jeff	|17

317
00:11:36,934 --> 00:11:38,400
- the defense calls
Britta perry.	|Jeff All	|17

318
00:11:38,467 --> 00:11:40,934
- now, are those
the high-heel boots

319
00:11:41,001 --> 00:11:42,400
He was talking about?	|Dean Britta	|17
- yes.	|Britta Dean	|17

320
00:11:42,467 --> 00:11:43,634
- are they comfortable?	|Dean Britta	|17
- yeah.	|Britta Dean	|17

321
00:11:43,701 --> 00:11:44,967
- i'm just curious.
they're cute.	|Dean Britta	|17

322
00:11:45,034 --> 00:11:46,434
- thank you.	|Britta Dean	|17
- miss perry...

323
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:48,134
Did you make
that crib sheet?	|Jeff Britta	|17

324
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:49,801
- no.	|Britta Jeff	|17

325
00:11:49,867 --> 00:11:51,333
- she confessed!	|Chang Jeff	|17

326
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:53,300
- she confessed to protect
her classmates,

327
00:11:53,367 --> 00:11:56,734
Because you were threatening
to flunk everyone!	|Jeff Chang	|17

328
00:11:56,801 --> 00:11:58,168
- you did what?	|Duncan Chang	|17

329
00:11:58,233 --> 00:12:01,367
- oh, shut your pompous vortex
of overlapping fangs!	|Chang Duncan	|17

330
00:12:01,434 --> 00:12:03,333
- hey, british dentistry
is not on trial.	|Duncan Chang	|17

331
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:05,001
- dean pelton,
i move this case

332
00:12:05,068 --> 00:12:06,500
Be thrown out of...

333
00:12:06,567 --> 00:12:07,600
The pool area!	|Jeff Dean	|17

334
00:12:07,667 --> 00:12:08,634
- well, it certainly--	|Dean All	|17

336
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:14,767
Well, it certainly sounds
to me

337
00:12:14,834 --> 00:12:16,801
That this young lady's
only crime

338
00:12:16,867 --> 00:12:19,134
Is being a hero
and wanting to be taller.

339
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,367
This tribunal is adjourned.	|Dean All	|17

340
00:12:20,434 --> 00:12:21,901
- wait! i cheated!	|Britta All	|17
- and we're back.	|Dean All	|17

341
00:12:21,967 --> 00:12:24,500
- objection. my client
did not cheat.	|Jeff All	|17

342
00:12:24,567 --> 00:12:25,667
- yes, i did.	|Britta All	|17

343
00:12:25,734 --> 00:12:28,500
- yes, she did...

344
00:12:28,567 --> 00:12:30,267
But why?

345
00:12:30,333 --> 00:12:32,701
That's the real question,
isn't it?

346
00:12:37,101 --> 00:12:39,001
The world wasn't
the only thing that changed

347
00:12:39,068 --> 00:12:40,068
On september 11th.	|Jeff All	|17

348
00:12:40,134 --> 00:12:41,267
- Jeff, come on.	|Britta Jeff	|17

349
00:12:41,333 --> 00:12:42,367
- five-minute recess?	|Jeff All	|17

350
00:12:42,434 --> 00:12:43,967
- no, no. there's nothing

351
00:12:44,034 --> 00:12:45,634
In the bylaws about recesses,
all right?

352
00:12:45,701 --> 00:12:47,634
The wheels of justice here
don't stop

353
00:12:47,701 --> 00:12:49,267
Just because you--aah!

354
00:12:49,333 --> 00:12:50,834
Time out! time out!

355
00:12:50,901 --> 00:12:52,634
Save the table!
save the table!	|Dean All	|17

357
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:56,801
Beginning transmission.

358
00:12:56,867 --> 00:12:58,634
The primary purpose seems
to be male bonding,

359
00:12:58,701 --> 00:13:00,101
And the attitude
during conveyance

360
00:13:00,168 --> 00:13:02,534
Of the random deceit is
apparently of great importance.

361
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:05,001
The humanoid is approximately
5'10" in height.	|Abed	|18

362
00:13:05,068 --> 00:13:06,467
- what are you doing?	|Troy Abed	|18

363
00:13:06,534 --> 00:13:08,300
- oh, hey. troy.

364
00:13:08,367 --> 00:13:09,634
I didn't see you.

365
00:13:09,701 --> 00:13:11,434
Um, how long
were you standing there?	|Abed Troy	|18

366
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:14,034
- you trying to mess
with me?	|Troy Abed	|18

367
00:13:14,101 --> 00:13:15,001
- yes,
that's what i was doing.

368
00:13:15,068 --> 00:13:16,534
You got me.

369
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:18,934
I was just messing with you,
but i guess i blew it again.	|Abed Troy	|18

370
00:13:19,001 --> 00:13:20,801
- yeah.

371
00:13:20,867 --> 00:13:22,367
You did.	|Troy Abed	|18

373
00:13:31,534 --> 00:13:33,367
- man, don't turn your back
on me.	|Chang Duncan	|18

374
00:13:33,434 --> 00:13:34,701
- it is on
like donkey kong!

375
00:13:34,767 --> 00:13:37,101
Have you got
a problem with me?	|Duncan Chang	|19

376
00:13:37,168 --> 00:13:38,867
- i don't like the fact
that you're walking around here

377
00:13:38,934 --> 00:13:41,233
Like you're better than me
in front of my students.	|Chang Duncan	|19

378
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:42,901
- i'm sorry. do you mind if we
have this conversation

379
00:13:42,967 --> 00:13:44,834
In a room with less balls?	|Duncan Chang	|19

380
00:13:47,934 --> 00:13:51,500
You're very confident,
i'll say that.	|Duncan Extra	|19

381
00:13:51,567 --> 00:13:53,367
- but you shouldn't be.	|Chang Extra	|19

382
00:13:53,434 --> 00:13:54,767
- what are you doing
out there?	|Jeff Britta	|20

383
00:13:54,834 --> 00:13:56,867
- you know i have a problem
with dishonesty.	|Britta Jeff	|20

384
00:13:56,934 --> 00:13:59,400
- you're on trial
for cheating!

385
00:13:59,467 --> 00:14:01,434
Fa--look, we'll be fine.

386
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:03,134
I just have to
go back out there

387
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:05,034
And make the case
that you're a good person--	|Jeff Britta	|20

388
00:14:05,101 --> 00:14:06,467
- you don't know that.

389
00:14:06,534 --> 00:14:07,701
You're just doing all of this

390
00:14:07,767 --> 00:14:08,734
'cause you want to
sleep with me

391
00:14:08,801 --> 00:14:09,901
I mean,
you said it yourself.

392
00:14:09,967 --> 00:14:11,400
You don't even want to
be my friend.	|Britta Jeff	|20

393
00:14:11,467 --> 00:14:12,834
- wait a minute.

394
00:14:12,901 --> 00:14:14,901
Wait, is that
what you thought i meant?

395
00:14:14,967 --> 00:14:16,467
Britta, look at me.

396
00:14:16,534 --> 00:14:17,600
Look at me!	|Jeff Britta	|20
- i am.	|Britta Jeff	|20

397
00:14:17,667 --> 00:14:19,701
- no, look how handsome
my face is.

398
00:14:19,767 --> 00:14:21,600
If all i wanted was sex,

399
00:14:21,667 --> 00:14:22,901
I could get it
from plenty of women

400
00:14:22,967 --> 00:14:24,867
Without having to go through
all this crap.

401
00:14:24,934 --> 00:14:26,734
I'm here because i like you,

402
00:14:26,801 --> 00:14:29,801
And i--i'd be psyched
to be your friend.

403
00:14:29,867 --> 00:14:31,434
I just didn't want to take
sex off the table

404
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:33,567
Without doing
my due diligence.	|Jeff Britta	|20

405
00:14:33,634 --> 00:14:35,034
- i actually believe you.	|Britta Jeff	|20

406
00:14:35,101 --> 00:14:37,034
- well, why wouldn't you?	|Jeff Britta	|20
- i don't know.

407
00:14:37,101 --> 00:14:39,400
I guess...same reason
that i cheated.

408
00:14:39,467 --> 00:14:43,200
I...just have more experience
being worthless.

409
00:14:43,267 --> 00:14:45,101
I think i left that
crib sheet on the floor

410
00:14:45,168 --> 00:14:46,534
Because i wanted
to get caught.

411
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:48,200
I'm so used to
screwing everything up

412
00:14:48,267 --> 00:14:49,967
I just wanted
to get it over with.	|Britta Jeff	|20

413
00:14:50,034 --> 00:14:53,634
- wait.
i think we have our defense.	|Jeff Britta	|20

414
00:14:53,701 --> 00:14:55,467
Gentlemen...

415
00:14:55,534 --> 00:14:56,901
My client is insane.	|Jeff All	|21

416
00:14:56,967 --> 00:14:58,867
- what?	|Britta Jeff	|21

417
00:15:03,184 --> 00:15:04,517
- gentlemen, i'm sure
you suspected...

418
00:15:04,583 --> 00:15:07,318
That ms. perry was pretty odd
before the recess.

419
00:15:07,384 --> 00:15:09,550
But if you could've heard
all the stuff

420
00:15:09,617 --> 00:15:11,084
She just told me
in the shower,

421
00:15:11,151 --> 00:15:13,583
You would realize
she is all the way out

422
00:15:13,650 --> 00:15:15,717
Of her entire damn mind.

423
00:15:15,784 --> 00:15:17,583
She doesn't want to succeed

424
00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:19,617
Because she doesn't think
she can.

425
00:15:19,684 --> 00:15:23,117
So she goes out of her way
to fail.

426
00:15:23,184 --> 00:15:24,483
That's crazy!

427
00:15:24,550 --> 00:15:26,483
But...

428
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:28,217
Do we really want
to make it a crime

429
00:15:28,284 --> 00:15:30,117
To be crazy at greendale?

430
00:15:30,184 --> 00:15:31,617
I mean, look at us.

431
00:15:31,684 --> 00:15:34,750
I mean, you two are arguing
about status at a college

432
00:15:34,817 --> 00:15:36,650
That correspondence schools
make fun of.

433
00:15:36,717 --> 00:15:40,418
Dean, you want so bad
for this place to be ivy league

434
00:15:40,483 --> 00:15:43,684
That you are putting us
at risk of electrocution.

435
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:46,650
Everyone on this campus
is nuts.	|Jeff All	|21

436
00:15:46,717 --> 00:15:49,117
- not me!	|Leonard Jeff	|22
- oh, come on, leonard.

437
00:15:49,184 --> 00:15:51,351
If you're gonna argue with me,
put on a bathing suit.	|Jeff Leonard	|22

438
00:15:51,418 --> 00:15:53,750
- busted.	|Leonard Jeff	|22

439
00:15:53,817 --> 00:15:57,318
- if you want to rehabilitate
your fellow inmate,

440
00:15:57,384 --> 00:16:00,351
you need to sentence her
to staying here with us.

441
00:16:00,418 --> 00:16:03,284
Because if crazy people
can't be at greendale,

442
00:16:03,351 --> 00:16:05,517
Where are we supposed to go?	|Jeff All	|23

443
00:16:10,984 --> 00:16:12,483
Wow, well, under the circumstances

444
00:16:10,984 --> 00:16:12,483
I'll recommend
that the accused

445
00:16:12,550 --> 00:16:14,450
Be fully exonerated.

446
00:16:14,517 --> 00:16:16,017
On the condition
that she receives

447
00:16:16,084 --> 00:16:17,650
Psychological counseling
on a weekly basis

448
00:16:17,717 --> 00:16:19,650
From a trained
mental health professional.

449
00:16:19,717 --> 00:16:21,884
Thinking maybe fridays,
nine-ish, something like that.	|Duncan All	|23

450
00:16:21,951 --> 00:16:23,450
All in favor say "aye."	|Duncan Dean Chang	|23


450
00:16:21,951 --> 00:16:23,450
aye.	|Dean Duncan	|23
aye.	|Chang Duncan	|23

451
00:16:23,517 --> 00:16:25,084
- yes!	|Jeff	|23
- wait, what?	|Britta Duncan	|23

452
00:16:25,151 --> 00:16:27,550
- that just happened.	|Duncan Britta	|23

455
00:16:43,617 --> 00:16:44,850
- greetings, abed.	|AbedAlien Abed	|24

456
00:16:44,917 --> 00:16:46,318
- greetings, commander.	|Abed AbedAlien	|24

457
00:16:46,384 --> 00:16:49,418
- t-t-tell me
about the one they call troy.	|AbedAlien Abed	|24

458
00:16:49,483 --> 00:16:51,117
- well, he is
rather arrogant

459
00:16:51,184 --> 00:16:52,917
And has no mercy
for weaker beings.	|Abed AbedAlien	|24

460
00:16:52,984 --> 00:16:54,884
- stop. stop doing this
right now.	|Troy Abed	|24

461
00:16:54,951 --> 00:16:56,184
- whoa, whoa, whoa.

462
00:16:56,251 --> 00:16:57,984
I'm not an alien.	|Abed Troy	|24

463
00:16:58,051 --> 00:16:59,717
- i never thought
you were.

464
00:16:59,784 --> 00:17:01,650
But this is insane, okay?

465
00:17:01,717 --> 00:17:04,284
Those are credible
alien hand movements.

466
00:17:04,351 --> 00:17:05,583
You invented
a whole language.

467
00:17:05,650 --> 00:17:07,184
I'm pretty sure
you rented a green screen.	|Troy Abed	|24

468
00:17:07,251 --> 00:17:08,583
- yeah.	|Abed Troy	|24

469
00:17:08,650 --> 00:17:09,784
- it would be less creepy

470
00:17:09,850 --> 00:17:11,251
If you were
actually an alien.	|Troy Abed	|24

471
00:17:11,318 --> 00:17:12,450
- this is what friends do.	|Abed Troy	|24

472
00:17:12,517 --> 00:17:15,817
- no.

473
00:17:15,884 --> 00:17:18,284
From now on, abed,

474
00:17:18,351 --> 00:17:20,184
friends don't mess
with each other.

476
00:17:21,617 --> 00:17:22,951
- okay?	|Troy Abed	|24
- cool.	|Abed Troy	|24

477
00:17:23,017 --> 00:17:24,117
- cool?	|Troy Abed	|24
- cool. bam bam!	|Abed Troy	|24

479
00:17:26,550 --> 00:17:27,917
- garrett, it's over.
he knows.	|Abed Garrett	|24

480
00:17:27,984 --> 00:17:29,217
- we will stick things
in his butt.	|AbedAlien Abed	|24

482
00:17:30,717 --> 00:17:32,251
- you're getting
a little sloppy.	|Troy Abed	|24

483
00:17:32,318 --> 00:17:33,650
- we went over-budget.	|Abed Troy	|24
- mm.	|Troy Abed	|24

485
00:17:43,850 --> 00:17:46,951
I've got it.

487
00:17:48,483 --> 00:17:53,318
* greendale, greendale

488

Oh!	|Pierce	|25

490
00:18:04,951 --> 00:18:06,384
I'm a fraud, annie.	|Pierce Annie	|25

491
00:18:06,450 --> 00:18:09,984
I'm no more of a songwriter
than you or billy joel.

492
00:18:10,051 --> 00:18:12,351
- but what about
the hawthorne wipes jingle?	|Annie Pierce	|25

493
00:18:12,418 --> 00:18:14,884

* you'll be wiping off
that ketchup *

497
00:18:20,051 --> 00:18:21,984
* with our wipes,
hawthorne wipes! *

498
00:18:22,051 --> 00:18:24,117
* you'll be wiping off
that mustard *

499
00:18:24,184 --> 00:18:26,450
* with our wipes
at the picnic! *	|Pierce Annie	|25

500
00:18:26,517 --> 00:18:28,617
- that's she'll be coming
around the mountain.	|Annie Pierce	|25

501
00:18:28,684 --> 00:18:30,684
- i know!
i steal everything.

502
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:32,784
You backed the wrong horse.
i got nothing.	|Pierce Annie	|25

503
00:18:32,850 --> 00:18:35,951
- pierce, you're musical.
you're creative.

504
00:18:36,017 --> 00:18:38,051
You can do this.
i believe in you.	|Annie Pierce	|25

505
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:39,684
- well, you shouldn't.
i quit.	|Pierce Annie	|25

506
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:42,583
- you listen up, pierce!

507
00:18:42,650 --> 00:18:43,917
I'm gonna tell you
what my mother told me

508
00:18:43,984 --> 00:18:46,251
When i wanted
to quit cheerleading.

509
00:18:46,318 --> 00:18:49,084
You're not very pretty,
you have no boobs,

510
00:18:49,151 --> 00:18:51,017
And you can't do a basket toss
to save your life,

511
00:18:51,084 --> 00:18:53,217
But you made a commitment.

512
00:18:53,284 --> 00:18:55,084
So pick up
your pompoms, pierce,

513
00:18:55,151 --> 00:18:57,750
Stuff your bra,
and get ready for the team bus

514
00:18:57,817 --> 00:19:00,817
To forget you at a taco bell,
because life is tough.

515
00:19:00,884 --> 00:19:02,351
But we soldier on,

516
00:19:02,418 --> 00:19:05,084
And that's
just the way it goes.

517
00:19:07,717 --> 00:19:10,550
- gonna play myself out.	|Annie Pierce	|25

518
00:19:13,117 --> 00:19:15,051
- the way it goes.

519
00:19:15,117 --> 00:19:17,084
That's it.	|Pierce Annie	|25
