[   'oh, hey! spanish.',
    "whoa.  I wouldn't dream of it. I just wanted to let you know about my spanish study group.",
    "i'm taking the class as an easy credit. I'm actually a spanish tutor.",
    'Board certified.',
    'yeah, i was willing to bet.. i\'m jeff. Or "Jefe". - We meet at the library at 4:00.',
    'You gonna be there? Un po\' di piu\'. That means "See you there".',
    'Bienvenuto! Hey, all right, come on in.  - I got the whole table. Welcome.',
    "Yeah, here's the, uh... contact sheet. Just put your stuff there. Man. Rest of the group is running late. But you and i can get acquainted.",
    "yeah, i like big talk. what's your deal?",
    "what's your deal and is god dead?",
    "You'd be surprised what gets back to these guys.",
    'Marry me.',
    'honesty?',
    "ah, that's a good deal.",
    'uh, i would have to go-- I would have to say, um, honesty, Because... I would say anything to get what i want. And i want you to like me. So, uh..',
    "really? Wow. you're easy.",
    'I just need five minutes, you guys, So go ahead and study all the verbs...in spanish.',
    "you guys aren't gonna believe this, But the rest of the group... Is here.",
    "I'm gonna go to the bathroom And bring my jacket, wallet, and keys with me In case there's a fire.",
    'uh, listen.',
    "yeah, but they're filtered, so that makes them safe.",
    'yeah, not mine, actually. I think abed took out a page on craigslist. And i was trained never to say this, But i think that group may be untutorable.',
    "so why don't you and i go study over--",
    'or drinks.',
    'all right. Look at this crew. All ready to study all night.',
    'but who studies with strangers, right? My name is jeff.',
    "you know, i've been a part of a lot of study groups that fell apart because of unresolved tension. Shouldn't we address Annie's concern?  Did we not invite her?",
    "i'm certified.",
    '<i>Dirty Dancing.</i> Hello.',
    "Uh, I'll be right back. But while I'm gone, you guys need to hash this stuff out. No stone unturned. - Go!",
    'Yeah, untutorable. - You like Thai food? I love Thai food.',
    "Why can't you see that for the compliment that it is? Ok, ok. I'm sorry. It was an accident. I did a little bit of lying  to get close to you. But how was I suppose to know that you were smart and cool... I mean, you look like Elisabeth Shue.",
    'What do you want me to do?',
    'Okay, if i do that, then dinner, right?',
    "Oh, you're gonna eat those words when you see my new car.",
    'All right, everybody! I want to say something. Everybody, sit down.',
    'You know what makes humans different from other animals?',
    "We're the only species on Earth that observes Shark Week. Sharks don't even observe Shark Week, but we do. For the same reason I can pick up this pencil, tell you it's name is Steve, and go like this. And part of you dies just a little bit on the inside, because people can connect with anything. We can sympathize with a pencil. We can forgive a shark. And we can give Ben Affleck an Academy Award for Screenwriting.",
    "People can find the good in just about anything but themselves. Look at me. It's clear to all of you that I am awesome, but I can never admit that, because that would make me an ass. But what I can do is see what makes Annie awesome. She's driven. We need driven people or the lights go out and the ice cream melts. And Pierce. We need guys like Pierce. This guy has wisdom to offer.",
    "We should listen to him sometime. We wouldn't regret it. And Shirley. Shirley has earned our respect, Not as a wife, not as a mother, but as a woman. And don't test her on that, because that thing about the jukebox was way too specific to be improvised. And Troy. Who cares if Troy thinks he's all that? Maybe he is. You think astronauts go to the moon because they hate oxygen? No! They're trying to impress their high-school prom king. And Abed. Abed's a shaman. You ask him to pass the salt, he gives you a bowl of soup, because you know what? Soup is better. Abed is better. You are all better than you think you are. You are just designed not to believe it when you hear it from yourself.",
    'I want you to look to the person to your left. Sorry. Look at the person sitting next to you.',
    'Yeah. I want you to extend to that person the same compassion that you extend to sharks, pencils, and Ben Affleck. I want you to say to that person, "I forgive you."',
    "You've just stopped being a study group. You have become something... unstoppable. I hereby pronounce you... a community.",
    "I agree with Abed that tonight has been very special. And now, if you'll excuse me, I have a dinner engagement with Britta. Britta?",
    'Fine.',
    "And I'm happy to report that one of the benefits of being a lying creep is having all the answers to tomorrow's test. And I'm happy to share them with anyone whose time I've wasted more than they've wasted mine.",
    'I make things up, and I got paid a lot of money to do it before I came to this school-shaped toilet. I was a lawyer.',
    "I don't have any of the answers. I'm gonna-- I'm gonna flunk the test.",
    "I am me... Well, the funny thing about being smart is that you can get through most of life without ever having to do any work. So, uh... I'm not really sure how to do that.",
    'Really?']
